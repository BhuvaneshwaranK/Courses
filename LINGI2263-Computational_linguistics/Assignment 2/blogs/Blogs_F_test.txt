So I went shopping today for my diet food, and I was pleasantly surprised to find a huge selection of food that are not only low in calories and carbs, but that also actually taste good! I loaded up on plenty of fruit and the fruit bars that Special-K makes....They are super good! Between eating right (the biggest problem is cutting out all the Coke I drink!) and doing my two miles a day on the treadmill, I should be bikini/tattoo ready for Orlando! I\'m one of those lucky woman that not only had seven kids who were all very large at birth, but I don\'t have one stretch mark on me....So I get the tummy flat and I\'ll look good in that two piece this June:)  Mark is dieting with me, so it\'s making it so much easier. We ate salads for dinner last night, but tonight I think I\'ll try us out on some fresh fish and veggies, along with some Skinny Cow ice-cream treats for dessert. I think we can handle that:)  OKay people, meet me back here in June and I\'ll show off my new body! I\'m excited! I think this is going to be a great Summer.
I teach school in a small rural school and love it! We have been married to the Cowboy of my dream since Aug 06 . We live on his families orginal homeplace and moved a old ranch house onto it to remodel(still in the process of finishing).Cowboy Steve, dayworks, runs beef cattle and farms cotton, wheat and hay grazer. I am a very outspoken or blunt women and was raised to stand up for myself. I am proud to be independent. I love living on a ranch/farm and I am loving being a mom!
Feast or Famine   I know it\'s been famine for a while on this blog, so I\'m going to take today to give you a feast...divided into courses for those of you who don\'t have much time. Then you can pick and choose what you\'d like to \'eat.\'This course- soup, light and easy.   In the last 3 weeks, the weather in Macau has dropped from 30 C to around 8-15 C (the coldest Macau gets). Basically, it\'s gone from 80+ with 90* humidity to around 40* with a windchill that makes it feel 30*ish. I\'ve actually seen my breath a few times. I hadn\'t really planned on winter based on past experience for about one more month. Thankfully, since I didn\'t have time to go and buy a comforter, I remembered that I had brought my sleeping bag with me. It looks really swank on my bed. I did buy one absolute necessity: a cloth cover for my toilet seat. (Remember, there\'s no indoor heating in Macau). So, my house is also about 30* ish with windchillllllllll. (Sorry, that\'s the chattering).  Today I woke up with the sound of the Macau Formula 3 Grand Prix in my ears. It goes by the park next to my house. Made me wish that Jim and Linda were here.  Save room for meat!
listening to ki,\' kradick in the morning today (ki,\'live.com) i heard them discussing that today is the day that you are able to begin\'pre-ordering\'apples new product, the ipad!....yay.... i am not sure on how to feel about this new product. of course many people love it (though they havent tried it) and have to buy it (though the ridiculous price) but...there are some major downfalls to it i feel: 1) you can\'t multitask! i don\'t know about yall, but when i\'m on my computer i have my internet up (with multiple tabs of course!) my media player playing music, sometimes microsoft word up, along with photoshop and many other programs. but not uh, no sir, this ipad is going to help keep you focused on one thing, because well, it\'s only capable of letting you do one thing. 2) no cd drive. or any other drive at that. basically its a touch screen version of the mac book air....without the function-ability of the air. and it weighs more. yay. 3) well im still working on the rest of my complaints which i will update you on later but for now i\'ll leave it at the name. the ipad. next thing you know theyre going to have the itampon.
We are leaving bright and early tomorrow morning to visit Aaron\'s mom for a week. It\'s going to be super cold, so we were trying to pack appropriately when we both looked at each other and sai,\'dWe don\'t really have any cold weather clothes!\'That\'s what living in a mild climate year round will get you. Ah well, I\'m sure we\'ll be good. Lots of layers, right?  My other concern is of course little girl. I have actually flown with her several times and she\'s been great, but those were all at 1 yr or less of age, so she was much less mobile and nursing put her right to sleep. I\'m not so sure how good she will do now. At least it is a fairly short flight, and Da,\'y is going too.  Man, they\'re terrible. And she\'s not even two yet! But I know most of this is my fault. I give in to her much too often, and now I am suffering the consequences. It\'s really hard to hold fast when you know you might be in for a 10, 15 minute tantrum and even those only end when you give in and say,\'Okay, come here. I can see you need help settling down. Do you want some milk?\'She never, I mean never, comes out of a tantrum on her own. At what point is it cruel to be ignoring her?  In any case, if you were wondering what set her off today, 1) Wanting to open the tums she saw when I grabbed a towel from the closet. 2) Wanting to walk in the kitchen where there were broken bits of a bowl I was cleaning up. 3) The dog took his toy that she had grabbed from him. It really is just the small stuff. How can I help my little girl release her frustrations more calmly?? Or is that even possible?
The past months have been bitter sweet...I love my baby boy/girl. But some things are just stress in me so much to the point where I can\'t take it no more. I can\'t wait till my baby is here and camdon starts his new job soon. So many things are changing. But it\'s for the better. I\'ve been so stressed and I don\'t know what to do anymore. I don\'t know how to handle it. And all this stress has nothing to do with the baby. I feel like I can\'t do anything without someone saying something back to make me feel stupid. It\'s to the point where I wanna leave and never come back. I\'m sick of been made fun of and I\'m sick of getting talked down to like I\'m some kind of dog. Things need to change but i know they won\'t. I guess I gotta suck it up and deal with it. I shouldn\'t have to…
I just finished, well, started and finished, the Twilight series over the weekend. I\'ve been sick, so I\'ve had some extra time on my hands.  As a literature minor, I\'d been curious about the books I\'d heard were\'well written.\'I wanted to read them to see what the big deal was.  Starting the books, I was initially annoyed. The melodramatic character of Bella Swan is a whiny (irritatingly so), obsessive, dark, misunderstood misfit, or so she feels. But, as I continued the first book, I got attached to its brilliance. Stephanie Meyer captures the emotions, passion, fear and romance for her primary audience of romantically inexperienced preteen and teenage girls. She creates an overwhelming dichotomy of passionate love and perfect friendship with the characters of Edward Cullen and Jacob Black.  In the end, I would never call the series a literary masterpiece. However, its brilliance to entrap the hearts of girls everywhere is undeniable. Even as I was reading it, I felt myself believing in what Edward and Bella have, despite knowing how unrealistic their relationship is, outside of the whole vampire thing.  Deep down, every girl wants an\'Edward\'--a man who is incredibly passionate, who believes and shares with her that he would die without her. She wants a love relationship where the spark never dies, where every kiss is more intense than the last and where the chemistry tears through her insides. And, she wants a man who longs for her to be with him at all times, who misses her intensely when they are apart, who protects her in every situation and who knows without a doubt that she is his soulmate.
So to start this off, it was just a normal day. I hung with my friends all day, and had a blast. Well, we all decided to drink that night. So I got some alcohol, and invited some people over to have a little get-together. Bad idea. It was about 1am, and the cops got called for a noise disturbance. Obviously, we were being loud but, personally, I didn\'t feel we were. Well as you all know, when a minor is intoxicated, they automatically get an MIP. Well, everyone in my room got one. Which I find completely unfair considering the fact that everyone in the house, except my Grandmother, was drinking. Well, once everyone went home, I was laying there thinking. Thinking if this is truly how I want my life to be. If I wanted to grow up with a criminal record. If I wanted to grow up an alcoholic. If I wanted to grow up not knowing if my life could be any better then what it is.
So many things are changing, yet everything is the same. I have not worked much since 2009. Soon all the things I have routinely done at home will come to a halt: baking, gardening, & park day. I will instead spend the weekends working shows in Virginia and Maryland visiting with friends, sleeping in different beds and driving rental vans. I will not be able to lean on Paul to back me up.   For many months I had the regularity of meditation and exercise keeping me on track, I was feeling good about going into the new working year, but for the past 2 months I have had a swollen knee due to a torn meniscus, which has put a halt to the intense work out I was enjoying. I\'m not sure why I lost the Breathe.  I don\'t hold onto familiarity and I am not dependent on regularity. I have never really felt settled anywhere. Many, many years ago I was working on the Celestine Prophecy workbook and one of the tasks was to connect the dots that lead to where you are now. In other words what events brought me here, right now. The goal was to understand that there are always many choices we can make, and the one we do make is significant to where we go: It is what we do in the moment that leads to the next moment. I believe I understand with such clarity why I chose to live on St. Thomas because it had everything I\'thought I wanted\'and everything I really did want.  I often wonder why I moved to Las Vegas. What is the lesson? What was the need?  I believe I moved to Las Vegas, to learn how to be a better parent. I moved here to meet more people who reassure me that by listening to my gut, connecting with my child, and considering his father, I will make the best choices to leave upon my son.  After only a month of moving into our home, I contacted a homeschooling group, who\'s description appealed to me.\'We hope to support and inspire each other on our journeys of living and learning. Because respect for the child is at the core of unschooling, we expect our members to act accordingly on the list and in real life gatherings. We embrace diversity and hope that all who join our group will respect each others\' differences and remain open to learning from each other.\'This group\'s members have changed since I first joined. There are only 3 families from our original beginnings that are still regulars in the group. Las Vegas, like St. Thomas is filled with transients.   One of the Four Noble Truths: The origin of suffering is attachment to transient things and the ignorance thereof. When I meet a friend I know they are not permanent, that my happiness does not rely on their being, but I know that just by calling them friend they have given me a little more understanding of my true self. They have left a lasting impression.  Another transient (though born here is leaving for life on the road) and one I call friend is leaving the LifeLearners, she is moving on, following her heart, facing her fears and becoming her true self. And again I realize that things will change. Our ego wants us to believe these changes are dramatic, but in reality they are subtle.  My ego misses my friend tonight. My ego sheds tears for the absent Wednesday chair.  I am feeling shaken and stirred. It\'s time to remember to how to breathe.
I picked her up on Saturday, after a night of lots of partying and little sleeping. Yes, I\'m gangster. We didn\'t get home until 5 in th morning on Sunday. We had lots of fun. We kayaked, shopped, tried on tons of clothes in a co-ed dressing room (I got caught by a male worker in my bra, then later, dancing retardedly - sweet! as in, embarrassing), went on rescue missions with the boys (rescued a boat load of unshaven, smelly, barefoot.. hippies! The stinkiest rescue mission of all time, thanks Bob!), got pedicures, pa,\'led at midnight to see phosphorescence, oogled hot guys, barbecued at Jays, crashed a dinner party at Tugboat Annies...  and I even got away with some stuff that I\'d never have gotten away with if Joshlynn wasn\'t there. Like taking pictures of ourselves in the round mirror in the mi,\'le of the marina store.
This is a normal sight at our house. My husband, at work. He\'s definitely not one to leave it at the office. Relaxing just isn\'t in his blood. He cannot do something halfway, and doesn\'t understand how anyone else can, either. When he doesn\'t have anything to do, he goes and learns something. Like one of 5 programming languages he taught himself in the 90\'s. How to repair his own bike. How to build a computer. How to speak French. Extensive reading on Bu,\'hist philosophy. Sailing in the 1800\'s. Sci Fi. Or changing his career path entirely, from Art (Yes, Art!!!) to Geology and Mineralogy to Geomicrobiology to Environmental Chemistry and Technology to Nanotechnology to Thinfilms to Solar Technology to Materials Science to Architecture and Sustainability to who knows what.  And he doesn\'t stop there. He not only learned French, he worked to get us a position there so I would be able to realize my dream of living in France one day. And now, he wants to find a way to go back.  A vacation for him is not laying on a beach with a beer. (Though he\'d happily walk through a museum with a beer.) On our honeymoon in New Orleans, he went to every museum there was. Thankfully, we\'re well matched. I love that, too.  He\'s kind of maxed out on the academics--though I guess he could get a second PhD (don\'t tell him, please!) As a professor, he\'s constantly busy teaching, recruiting, researching, mentoring, leading a solar decathlon team, and now heading up an entirely new degree program. He\'s not tenure-track, but even if he was and got it, he said he wouldn\'t change a thing. It\'s who he is. The idea of taking it easy just isn\'t a part of his DNA. He can\'t not do his best. I love that about him. I love how hard he works, both for his calling\'s sake and for his family\'s sake. I love that when he believes in something, it is with every fiber of his being. I love his devotion.  This week, he figured something out. For the first time in 36+ years, he\'s bored.  Heaven help us.
Introducing  Cole Isaac Gilbert    The baby is here!  Thanks to everyone who has helped out in the past few weeks, especially those guest posters.  I\'ll continue to be on semi-maternity leave over the next few weeks, but I wanted to share the good news and my birth story (for those interested).  Cheers!  Christine  Cole Isaac Gilbert  Born: 3/5/10 9:50 PM  8 lbs 12 oz  21 inches long  \'The Cure\'  I had breezed past my due date and by Friday my midwife wanted me to get an ultrasound to make sure the baby was still thriving in his post-40-week world.  We were planning a homebirth, a carefully weighed decision based in part on the nearly perfect health I had been experiencing throughout the pregnancy and my strong desire to avoid a c-section, especially since we would be birthing in the US, where c-section rates top 30%. It\'s not a choice for everyone, but we were well-educated about the options and it felt right.  That afternoon, I ate lunch and headed over to the ultrasound appointment.  Drew and I sat in  silence as the tech tried to jiggle our baby into movement.  The bio physical scan scored the baby based on 4 types of movement, from rolling over to \'practice breathing\'.  Our score?  Zero.  I drank some juice.  I poked the baby and wiggled my abs.  After 30 minutes, our midwife transferred us to the hospital for more tests.  The baby wasn\'t moving.  Remember that perfectly healthy pregnancy I talked about?  Well apparently on Week 40, Day 4 I developed pregnancy induced hypertension.  Normally you\'d see this after the six month point, when the women\'s blood pressure starts to creep up and her kidneys begin dropping protein into the urine and her feet and hands might get really swollen.  According to the blood work, I had moved past that first stage of just hypertension, beyond mild pre-eclampsia and was now looking at some of the scarier effects like my kidneys not working correctly, blood clotting issues and potential seizures (when blood pressure in a pregnant women gets too high they don\'t stroke out, they have a seizure  fun fact).  The cure?  The doctor sat down and tried to couch it as nicely as possible.  \'The only cure is to have this baby.\'  We didn\'t freak out, in fact we were very calm about the matter.  We spent about 30 minutes quizzing the doctor on the relative merits of induction verses cesarean, the likelihood of success based on cervical favorably, bishop score and methods used, and ultimately what did he think was the safest for everyone involved?  \'If it was my wife or daughter? A c-section\'.  I think everyone (the doctor, nurses and midwife included) were a bit surprised when we said, \'Okay.\'  Maybe they expected us to  fight it, to try to come up with some way to birth at home or to take the insane risk of disregarding the medical advice we had been given.   But to us, a home birth was about safety, not about some ego-driven one upmanship over our child-bearing peers.  A low risk, healthy birth is safest when left alone  but all of that goes out of the window once there is complications.  If you are sick, if your baby is at risk, you want a doctor there.  That\'s why we did the tests and ultrasounds  to rule out anything that would cause us problems down the road.  Well, it worked.  I signed the paperwork and they prepped me for surgery.  I won\'t go into too much detail about the actual surgery, as it\'s not pleasant.  You wouldn\'t expect it to be, I\'m sure, but I might have of had a slightly harder time than other women as the spinal made me extremely sick.  There is one moment I\'ll always remember though, and it\'s the single bright spot in the experience.  I was gasping for breath from beneath the sickly plasticy smelling oxygen mask, with my own vomit drying on my face and in my hair, trying to not succumb again and I heard my baby\'s first cry.  I couldn\'t have been further from the moment, forgetting completely why I was subjecting myself to this and his piercing scream pulled me right back.  I burst into tears and felt this clear, indescribable  joy.  Afterward, I got everything I wanted.  Cole was alert and latched an hour after surgery (when they stabilized me enough to permit breastfeeding).  I stayed up with him most of the night, marveling his perfect little features, the way he pouted (my husband says he gets this from me) and the way his breathing gets excited as he gets close to me.  I had spent all this time planning the perfect birth, and I got almost none of my wishes, except one.  A healthy baby.  Later I would tell Drew that the disappointment, the anger, the sadness of having our plans dashed would take time to heal.  Really though, it  hasn\'t been time.. the cure has been Cole.  Being with him has been so opposite, so perfectly wonderful, it\'s redemptive.  I feel like I won the baby lottery.
Today\'s guest post is from Alison at http://cheeseweb.eu, a very cool expat blogger.  I especially liked this post for the insight into expat life, but also a new twist on the \'Why Blog?\' debate.  Once you\'re done reading this be sure to check out her excellent photography here.    When I started blogging, I wasn\'t trying to make money on-line or become famous. In fact, I never expected anyone other than my friends and family would read it. But now, I\'m pretty sure that blogging saved my expat life.  I moved to Belgium five years ago as a trailing spouse. My husband and I decided together that we wanted to try living in Europe. The opportunity came up sooner than we expected, when his company offered to move us to Brussels. Legalities being what they are in Belgium, I was unable to get a work-permit as the trailing spouse, so my days were filled with getting our new life settled.  Back then, blogging wasn\'t as ubiquitous as it is now, and I didn\'t know much about it, but I got tired of writing the same things and answering the same questions in a dozen e-mails. I had learned basic web design and HTML in school so I decided to start a website to share stories and photos with my friends and family back home.  My blog posts were basically extended letters. I didn\'t think much about grammar or structure. My posts didn\'t have a topic other than what I had been up to since the last time I wrote. I never expected anyone that didn\'t know me would bother much with my blog.  In those first few months, I wrote only about happy things   new places we travelled to, new discoveries we made, etc.  The shiny newness of expat life wore off pretty quickly though. The reality was I was mired in mountains of Belgian bureaucracy and red-tape. We had no support from my husband\'s company; we didn\'t speak the language; we knew no one and we lived in a small community with limited public transportation. I spent most of my days feeling isolated and depressed and wondering what the hell I had done.  I didn\'t want to burden my family and friends with my woes. Honestly, I felt like a failure for being depressed in the first place. I mean, I was living in Europe after all. Something that is a dream for most people was my reality. Except most days it felt more like a nightmare.  I turned to the blogosphere for help. Although there weren\'t many expat blogs based in Belgium at that time, I found some blogs written by expat women in other countries who were writing about the exact feelings I was having. Su,\'enly I didn\'t feel so alone and it gave me the courage to write about what I was really experiencing.  It was scary to put my stress, struggles and depression out there, but instead of scorn for my whining, I started to get email and comments from other women in my situation. Some were already in Belgium, some were planning an expat move and all of them had similar fears and worries as me.  I was contacted by an expat news website in Belgium and asked to do a weekly column about my experiences in Belgium. Through that column, even more trailing spouses contacted me and encouraged me to keep writing and sharing.  It didn\'t happen overnight, but gradually things got better. Because of my blog, I met people, I had an outlet for my stress and worry and I had a sense of purpose. Blogging and the support of my readers gave me the courage to pursue my career as a photographer.  Five years later, my blog and my life have changed dramatically. First of all, we have both moved out of isolation   me to the centre of Brussels and my blog to its own domain.  CheeseWeb is now much less focused on my day to day life and more on expat life in general. It covers a range of topics about life and travel in Belgium. I have guest posters on different topics from art to technology and I write about many different travel destinations around Europe.  Blogging opened so many doors for me in the early months of my expat life and continues to today. I honestly believe that blogging saved my expat life.
commercialized us!!!! How many of us in today\'s world have time to think just for a second how commercialized the world has become or rather we have become? Are v now what we really wanted to be? Are we synchronized with what we have studied and what we are doing?Let me place myself as an example. I have studied electronics and instrumentation but i am sitting for placements for a software company. Ok lets say thats what life is. But when we know thats what life is then why do we have many other options other than comp.science and the IT??? If what everybody wants is money then yes software is the right field but 10 years from now where would u get ur computers if u r programming down der? Who would teach ur children if ur friends are along with u?? Everybody wants the IITs and IIMs but how many of them work for INDIA?? Friends just sit back and think where did your journey start what was YOUR goal are u reaching for the one u started ur journey?? Many of us think our aim is to earn and keep the family happy. But how many of us are happy in the process. A family always supports what you do if it is right. A happy mind is necessary to keep the family happy right? Job satisfaction is most important i feel rather than money. But very few would agree with me because the world is like that. Comp.science students no hard feelings. This blog is dedicated to all the hardware STUDENTS. I would say ENGINEERS coz i dont know how many of us will really work as hardware engineers.
I realized that the best time to start potty training is when the kid is around 5 months old. When the head doesn\'t need support and the neck is firm. At that age, they don\'t run around and it is easier to put them on the potty. You will be able to identify when they want to\'go\'so you start putting them on the small potty. For my son that\'s what my mom did - that habit continued and he kind of started knowing that\'If I am put on the potty I must sort-of push\'. Now my son is a year old and quite recently I started the habit of taking him to the bathroom and putting him on the regular potty. So now he knows to say\'baa\'(bathroom) when we wants to\'go\'. I see that some parents (new of course!) are finding it difficult to potty train kids after they reach the walking age. Kids just get used to the diaper and refuse to sit in one place. Of course, this doesn\'t come with the side effects of other\'settais\'(I think vaguley translates to naughty behavior) -These days he loves to go to the bathroom and play with the water. So he will make that\'I have to go\'face . I tried putting him on the smaller potty - he sat there for 2 seconds and started pointing to the door and he says\'baa\'. I took him to the bathroom and he immediately ran to the bucket to play with the water! So I am as usual running behind him!
Missionary Man Bradford got his mission call. He\'ll be serving in the Ghana Accra Mission. He reports to the MTC there on Oct. 23rd. We have a lot of shots and passport getting to do before that.    Yea, Bradford. We are excited for you and very proud that you are worthy and willing to serve in this fashion. We love you.

My dad works on submarines, so I\'ve been around them here and there (and certainly heard about them) since I was a little kid. I vaguely remember going on a tour of one when I was probably about 9 or 10. Last Christmas my dad took me & Gabe on a tour of a sub in Virginia, and let me tell you, they seem a LOT smaller inside when you\'re a grownup.  But I digress. At some point I was talking with my dad about an analytics problem I was working on, and describing the process I was using to try to figure something out. He told me the tale of the USS Scorpion, a sub that went down somewhere in the Pacific, and the process the Navy used to locate the sub. I was transfixed as he told me about John Craven, the mastermind behind the search effort, and his use of an old mathematical theory that quantifies the value of hunches. They used it to successfully locate the sub. (More about that soon.)  Anyway, that was enough of a motivation to get me to read this book, and now I AM OBSESSED WITH SUBMARINES. Seriously. It\'s out of control. But they\'re fascinating! The book is full of all true stories of submarines from WWII through the Cold War, and it was the first time that a lot of these stories were made public. I can\'t recommend it enough.
That\'s Not My Name and That\'s OK I used to think walking was merely a way to get from point A to point B or to exercise. Sometimes both. When I\'m alone, I\'m plugged into my iPod. When I\'m with a friend, we talk. A walk is a walk is a walk until I walked with Claire.   The girl doesn\'t know it, but she always knows exactly what to do and say to put things in perspective.   This morning we decided to walk uptown to the post office and library. She put on her Dora sneakers and tan jacket, and I surprised her with new purple mittens with hearts and rainbows I bought her on winter clearance. This made her very happy.   I put on my pink backpack loaded with the envelopes that needed to be mailed, my phone and some money since I was pretty sure I had library fines to reconcile. Claire put on her Dora backpack.   The weather was lovely   sunny and about 40 degrees when we started walking. Sidewalks are inconsistent for the first few blocks, so we cut down an alley to avoid street traffic. As we passed a garage, Claire asked, \'Where\'d my shadow go?\'   \'What, honey?\' I asked.   She stopped. \'My shadow, Grammy.\'   Shadow? But of course! I haven\'t thought about my shadow since I was a kid, except to maybe avoid looking at it when I was obese.   \'It\'s hi,\'en by the garage,\' I told her. \'Let\'s move back into the sunshine.\'   \'There it is! It\'s big!\' she said. \'You have a big shadow, too, Grammy!\' and she waved. \'See my hand?\'  I waved back with both hands. She giggled.  \'I see your fingers in the shadow,\' she said.   When we turned the corner we were back on a sidewalk and our shadows were in front of us. Claire hopped over each crack for the rest of the block, thrilled that her shadow kept up with her.   We got to a corner at which we had to cross a street. I was holding her hand and was just going to walk her across when it dawned on me that I could teach her how to properly cross a street.   \'Always stop before walking out on to the street,\' I said. \'Look to your left. Do you see a car coming?\'  Looking very concentrated, she peered down the street. \'No,\' she said seriously.  \'Now look to your right. Any cars?\'  \'Nope.\'   \'OK, that means we can cross safely.\'   We walked down a street I\'ve walked for years, but I\'d never really noticed that the Purinton\'s house was blue or the rental next door had green trim until Claire pointed it out. Then she spied tiny purple flowers in the next yard.   \'Oooo! Those are crocuses,\' I told her.   \'Crocheches,\' she repeated. Close enough.   I wouldn\'t have noticed them on an ordinary walk. I notice them in my own yard because I\'m looking for them, but crocuses are even better when you\'re not seeking them out and spectacular when you unexpectedly get to introduce them to a 2-year-old who loves the colors purple and green.   \'I run real fast, Grammy!\' and she took off. I kept up by walking more briskly, but it was fun to let her get to the next house a little before I did.   We were getting close to another corner and she took my hand. We stopped, she looked both ways, and we walked safely across.   We went to the post office first, which is next door to the library. I handed the envelopes to the mail clerk. Claire said, \'I want to see,\' so I lifted her up to sit on the counter.   \'I like your mittens,\' said the clerk. Claire\'s shy and so she just smiled and looked down at the hearts and rainbows.   \'Can she have a lollipop?\' he whispered to me. I no,\'ed.   \'Would you like a lollipop?\' he asked Claire.  \'Yes,\' she said rather boldly, and I thought, Yeah, I\'ve always preferred candy over compliments, too.   She reached in the bag and pulled out a small chocolate flavored Tootsie-Pop. She\'s definitely my gran,\'aughter.   \'What do you say?\' I asked her.   \'Thank you,\' she said staring at her mittens again, but he heard her.   \'You\'re welcome,\' he said.   She insisted I open the wrapper before we left the post office and I didn\'t want her to bring it into the library, so we sat on a bench out front and she ate her lollipop.   \'A black truck,\' she pointed to the street. \'That\'s Papa\'s truck.\' Her dad\'s dad is Papa and drives a pickup.   \'No, that\'s not Papa\'s truck, but it looks like it,\' I said.  \'That\'s a red car,\' she continued and crunched her lollipop.   \'Hear that?\' she asked.  \'That\'s a blue jay,\' I said.   \'Blue jay,\' she repeated and took another bite of her lollipop.  Watching Claire observe the world around her   the world I\'ve very much taken for granted   this Ting-Tings song came into my head:   They call me girl They call me Stacey They call me her They call me Jane   That\'s not my name That\'s not my name That\'s not my name That\'s not my name  They can call me Emily. They can call me Shawna. But that\'s not my name. I\'m Grammy. I\'m Mom. I\'m Lynn. I know who I am. I know how I lost weight. I could spend all kinds of money fighting these bogus websites illegally using my images only to find other sites doing the same thing. Or I can let it go and live in the world around me. My real world.   I have a shadow. The crocuses are blooming. I\'m teaching Claire how to cross the street and what a blue jay sounds like. People can believe what they want about my images. I know what\'s true. Nothing else matters.
Time has been judgemental ..eversince its existence is known ;)  Do not you feel so?.......TIME just the word seems so common even in the illiterates...why? I think it is because it affects and judges us all. Its impact is wide enough to neglect its name\'TIME\'.  The galaxies, the stars, the Universe.....as a whole has been judged by time. Their states depict the impact and the judgment of time on them. Beautiful and ruthless TIME can be at times :)  As they say about the mutual existence of things good vs evil, love vs hate....I was wondering who can oppose the merciless judgments of time?????.........there is something :) that can ditch time and we all can escape from the judgments of time........The Black holes  Wish we had something to switch between both of them......so that we can give a nice TIME to TIME looking for us......you got me right\'The time machine
I woke up today and got on with my morning rituals   checked my Gmail, Facebook, and listened to some feel-good songs on Youtube. Then I logged on to Google Talk after quite a few weeks to update myself on my friends\' statuses, their profile pictures, etc. It gave me a fair clue of how they were doing. I came to Facebook again. But this time around, I found too much information about the same people   what they like, which groups and activities they are a part of, which games they play, where they have been traveling, whom they have been hanging out with, bla bla   and all this confused me. Trust me, a year back, I kinda used to dislike Google chatting, since it prevented me from thinking about what I was saying. I preferred snail emailing to chatting as it was more static and easier to handle. And today, I find myself preferring Gtalk to Facebook. Why? Simply because Gtalk is not a social networking site where I have to keep projecting an image of my Self. Gtalk is a directed, simple two-dimensional medium wherein I can have a one-on-one conversation with a person I am actually interested to talk to and know about. Wow! Now all of a su,\'en this has become a privilege, thanks to Facebook and twitter. Su,\'enly, I feel relieved that I have some real people who are not too a,\'icted to Facebook, and who are not looking at my \'information\' to know me, but are going beyond it to spend real time with me outside these news updates. And hey, I honestly feel this change happened in just the past one year, when all of us got overly a,\'icted to Facebook. Social Networking with people who live in the same city and area as you   Quite a bad idea. I am very much for picking up my landline,calling up my friend and catching up especially when I live in the same country as him/her, and where local rates are the same as internet costs. I want something real dude   like a human voice maybe? And not a profile picture to connect to a person. Eeks. Creeps me out.  I think its high time someone started a Facebook Regulatory Board   on what can be done and what can\'t be done on Facebook. It is such a mess otherwise. And NO. Privacy settings hardly matter and hardly help. Well yes, I do hear some of your counter arguments btw   That Facebook helps me market my events, it helps me connect to older school bu,\'ies, it obliviates hierarchies and protocols between people. Hmm . Alright..  I can accept that to an extent. But whatever happened to respecting privacy? And its not even about others\' privacy here. Respecting your own privacy   what happened to that? Its lost. Gone. I find a lot of people not caring or thinking about what they put up on Facebook, I find myself in that situation too, mainly because Facebook started as a Fun, light-hearted means to pass time. Su,\'enly you wake up to the fact that its a lot more of a serious affair. Highly unsettling. Anyway.. Being the optimist that I am and desperate to conclude things on a good note like Bollywood movies, I do accept that dear old facebook can be positive at times, which is why I have still not terminated my account there. For instance, there was almost a virtual, spontaneous school reunion    thanks to an old class photo which someone posted (it happened a few days back and delighted me  ). Everyone started commenting, feeling nostalgic about old teachers and old life, thanks to this photo - as high as 120 comments in a day!! Or a friend who was able to get in touch with me when she really needed my help, but was in some remote part of the world and had lost my mail. Now that   is truly awesome!
Culling In the winter, I find myself in a state of retreat, like a tree, in an inert state of waiting. Watching. The sun ekes through the windows at the most pitiful angle. I push my writing desk right up against the window to try and absorb whatever light is going to be doled out. Inspiration trickles in droplets one by one. Inertia wanes. Daily business unfurls at its slow French city pace across my square. It is tempting to passively watch. In past years, I have always done what it takes to shake things up, to keep things from freezing over, but it\'s true. Winter has always been hard for me.  This is my first winter with the baby. While I still won\'t say everything changed, something very big has shifted. A lot of time goes into animating, teaching, comforting and reassuring my little boy. I am blowing on coals. New coals. Hot coals. I am constantly moving to stay one step ahead. I must explain to him what we plan to do. The spontaneity that I used to rely on to shake things up during the winter has been transformed into my breath on these hot coals.  This week in the kitchen cure, I am thinking about optimization, which translates to freedom. I\'ll take it wherever I can get it. I am culling equipment from the kitchen, and most of all, moving things around. I have a couple of shelves full of things I rarely use, so I am moving these things out and creating new space for the things I should have close by.  Do you have any equipment on your counter that just takes up real estate? I have very little counter space. In fact, when you count that which is taken up by the grinder, the mixer, and the kettle, I don\'t have any at all. I have become adept at using cork mats as anchors for cutting boards along the edge of things. When I am cooking things that involve more mise en place than simple slicing and chopping on little boards along the way, my kitchen moves out to one of the two work tables outside the kitchen.  Now that the sun is finally beginning to fill the house again, It\'s time to put the pastry table back by the window, and move my writing desk to a quiet place in the house. This is a very good time for my kitchen cure. I need to optimize my kitchen, to do away with unnecessary steps. Time is more precious now than ever. Labels: 2010 Kitchen Cure    by Lucy Vanel | 13:50 | 2 comments   08 MARCH 2010 Foraging: Thoughts on a Monday This talk about the people on the market who sell their foraged wild herbs got me thinking this weekend. It was cold up there and the ground is still frozen solid. I spent some cozy time indoors with a piece of tracing paper over a map of the land, dreaming about what we might try to accomplish this year in the garden. Last year we simply cleared the field by hand and spread mixed wild flower seed, and it was very nice. We also randomly planted some vegetables around here and there, and we were rewarded with some very nice zucchini, potatoes and beans.   While I am thinking about dried herbs and seeds and the ones I loved the most as I replenish my spice drawer, I realize that it\'s the wild ones that get me so excited at the market here in the city. One very useful task this summer will be to learn to see more wild herbs and edible plants all around us on country walks and out in the field outside the kitchen door. I often catch sight of old women out on steady and slow early morning walks in the hills when it is warm out, carrying small baskets. This I suppose is the bucolic image that causes the tourists to come and clear everything from sides of the well worn hiking trails. But in the little homey places away from the stations, the farmland and grazing paths, where we can walk all day barely seeing anybody, it can\'t hurt to cut a sprig here or there.   Foraging anything takes a bit of method in thoughtfulness. For example, when out picking herbs, have the sense enough to use a field knife and cut them, leaving the base in tact. Leave the roots, and cut only what you need. There\'s no need to rip any plant whole from the ground, effectively exterminating it. Give it a chance to grow back. Last year I did transplant some wild strawberries that spread and grew from their little sheltered spot under the cherry tree. But I was careful about it, and did it with respect for the path I was walking on. Mindful of my intention to nurture this plant as a special project, I took the whole plant from a place where thousands more were growing.

Since getting another pair was outta question next was to do some quick fix.. I did not seem stickable so we decided to pin it up with something. Babloo got some board pins and tried to pin it, punch it ,stand on it and what not! In vain! It was 6 27 and missing this bus meant I had to roam slipper-less in office till 8! Chuck it! He lost hope! He had only one piece of advice for me. Think you are walking to sabarimala and run! Wat else cud I do? I threw the blackies into the bin and raaan! I was feeling the office carpet with my bare feet for the first time.. the A/c cold stairs and the marble lobby too  I was soo embarrassed I could hardly walk. The bus stand was a good distance away and I had to walk all the way bare foot! To top it all, it was raining! I was praying no one would notice and ask me. Thankfully no one I knew came in the way of my run! My boot cut jeans was serving its full purpose today! It was doing the job of hiding my bare feet! Spotted the bus! I ran inside and it started.
Beyond Getting There: What Travel Days Show Us  Today\'s guest post is by Gillian at One-Giant-Step.com sums up for me that imperceptible change that happens when you travel  you start appreciating things you never thought you would.  In that process, maybe you even learn a new way to see the world.    Who is it that said \'It\'s not about the destination, it\'s about the journey\'? Nine months of full time traveling has proven to me that this is absolutely true.  Before leaving on this trip the thought of an 8 or 10 hour bus trip was pretty daunting. The longest trips we\'d taken were on planes, where they serve drinks and meals and we can pass the time watching movies. Eight hours on a bus, without the same amenities sounded like torture but we jumped in right from the start with a 22 hour ride from Lima to Cusco that, while not the most comfortable ride, got us into the swing of things pretty quickly.  Once we got a routine down snacks packed, books prepared, podcasts ready and had determined our favorite seats on the drivers side, no window bar blocking the view, no children nearby bus journeys became easy and now travel days are some of my favorite days.    They are a chance for quiet reflection, to leave behind what is past, to think about the place we are leaving and start thinking about how we will remember our experiences there that great evening we had at the market, the interesting people we met at the cooking course, the horrible bed at the guesthouse. They are a chance to look forward, to anticipate what is coming, and to plan ahead where will we go next, how will we get there where will we stay. They are a chance to stare out the window and think about where we\'ve been and where we\'re going, about past successes and future plans when else is there a chance to do nothing but quietly think?  Travel days let us learn a little bit about the people and culture of the places we visit. Sitting in an airport, bus station or train depot gives me a great vantage point to see how people relate to each other. Who is traveling with who? Where might they be going, and why? Are they traveling for work, or holiday, or to visit family? Who are they meeting or leaving behind?  In a small northern Turkish town we witnessed a heart-wrenching goodbye between two young men. Turkish men are very close - it is normal to see them holding hands and embracing each other   and this couple seemed heartbroken to be leaving each other. One boy sat in the seat ahead of us, perhaps on his way to school or military service, his friend stood outside the bus. They spent their remaining time together with hands pressed against the glass, trying to talk through the window and texting each other on their phones. I don\'t understand Turkish but is was clear they were going to miss each other terribly.  I like the act of traveling, the moving forward, the getting somewhere. I love watching the scenery slowly change from rolling hills to flat plains, along high twisty mountain roads or perfectly straight desert highways   there is always lots to see. One of my favorite bus rides is still that first 22 hour ride between Lima and Cusco. I will always remember dawn breaking over the altiplano, the smoke rising from the llama herder shacks and the sun glinting off the frost that covered the ground.  There are plenty of stories to be told about dodgy bus trips, or awful plane rides, or the never-ending tuk tuk/minivan/bus/boat combination what would we do without those stories? But there are also plenty of journeys that are made perfectly lovely the lemon spritz on Turkish buses, the meals served on Argentinean buses, or the comfy bed on the overnight Thailand train.  Travel days are an integral part of travel. They are filled with possibility and anticipation of what lies ahead. I like the optimism they have, the sense that fun and adventure lie ahead. No matter how long or short the journey they will always be my favorites.
Neither do i have that deep a knowledge about the game to understand nuances.. nor am i sharp enough to rattle out how many runs India won the nth match of the xth world cup by. This blog is not about that.. This blog is to say\'Thankyou Sourav\'for making cricket that\'extra special\'. I dont know if it would have been the same for me without you. Yesterday, as I was watching the India - Eng ODIs i felt something strange... Its something i have been doin over the last 8 o,\' years, looking at you on the field.. changing field placements, smiling, frowning, exalting, shirt waving,jumping, puching, yelling,scolding and what not.. and every moment.. was pure joy. I did read somewhere..\'Sourav Ganguly pulled at the heartstrings of the masses like no other cricketer had done before\'and I definitely agree.Being responsible for the collective mood of a nation,over such a long duration - fabulous job done.
Then and now   It\'s been ages since I have actually written anything here.Had been busy with lots of things apart from work.As i see,my last post here(apart from pics) is about the jhakkas DSN with Anandji.Now when I look back,so much change has come in life.Earlier my behaviour reflected my gloomy feelings of dejection and frustration.How stupid i had been ! And now....the smile is back :)   I\'ll start off with what i\'d been doing post jhakkas DSN.Well, in her book \'The Secret\',Rhonda Byrone mentioned the law of attraction according to which an individual\'s focused positive thinking can result in life-changing results such as increased wealth, health, happiness and more.In Art of Living, we call it the power of \'Sankalpa\'.And seriously things happen when you have faith and confidence...Within a month of DSN,i was on my way to Bangalore ashram for an advanced course with Guruji.The calm and serene atmosphere of ashram & Guruji\'s darshan-amazing !  But that was not all...I experienced Guru Grace in full throttle yet again...In dec,i was again off to Bangalore for three weeks. 21 amazing days @ 21st km...memories to be cherished for a life time! And finally i became an Art of living teacher....it all seems like yesterday! Last week i finished my first basic course.It was amazing to see the transformation in the participants in just six days.Hearing participants\' experiences about how just six days made a difference to their lives was unbelievable.so stiff and rigid on the first day and glowing with happiness as they were leaving on the last day...Truly Guru Grace throughout...It\'s not we who are taking the course,it\'s HIM !!!  Thanks Guruji for filling our lives with love,joy and enthusiasm !!!  P.S. - Being happy is a practice. Being unconditionally happy is a practice: Come what may, today I\'m going to smile. Anyway, everything is going to die! Everything is going to vanish and disappear---so what! Who cares! Let me at least be happy, smile this moment, enjoy my very breath... Sri Sri
History waiting to repeat? -  The family visit to Agra last week was for the benefit of my two young nephews aged 9 and 7 years who had never seen the Taj. Strangely the visit for me turned out to be a morose one. The Taj did not seem as splendorous as it used to. The grandeur of its marble seemed to have been visibly effected, presumably, by pollution since I last saw it around two and half years ago. The badly lit inside was depressing and too claustrophobic. The too well known story of 22,000 craftsmen having their hands cut off upon the orders of the Emperor after the completion of the monument seemed to stain the beauty of the Taj as I looked at it.   Visit to the Agra Fort was no better. How Akbar, the so called ëemperor\' died suspected to have been poisoned by his own ambitious son Jahangir. How Jahangir blinded his own son Khusraw, a contender for the throne as per Akbar\'s will. Shah Jahan, Jahangir\'s son killed his own brothers to secure the throne and was finally imprisoned by his own son Aurangzeb in this very Agra Fort ! Listening to the guide giving the tales of treachery, deceit, barbarism, cruelty and ruthless ambition that was played out in these monuments of Moghul historicity, I wondered how this land of Vedic culture based on truth and dharma gave way to such lowly culture of killings, loot, plunder and lust!  Greed, lust, cruelty and barbarism reflected in every story told by the guide. He showed us the phansi ghar in the basement (not open to public so we could just peep in) just below the Jahangiri Palace which incidentally was a place for rest and pleasure for the women in the emperor\'s harem. It made me wonder why a phansi ghar was situated inside the living quarters and just below the place where the emperor indulged in pleasures. I was then told by the guide that this was the place where the women (queens) of the harem who fell out in disfavour were tortured and executed! Only a Moghul emperor could drink the choicest of wines and enjoy pleasures sitting atop a dungeon where hapless and screaming women were being tortured and tormented.  Looking down from the Fort we were shown a tank like structure and were curious. The guide related the story. It was a favourite sport of the members of the royal family. Elephants were kept around the tank deprived of water in hot seasons. They were drugged to make them thirstier. In that state after days of deprivation of water, they were led to this tank which was filled with alcohol. As they drank the alcohol, in that inebriated state of extreme thirst, they bloodied each other as the emperor and other royals watched with pleasure!  This was the culture that invaded the land where Sanatan Dharama was practiced. A land where animate and inanimate were revered, where birds, animals and even rivers, mountains were worshipped!  That Hindu India was prosperous and full of riches has been chronicled by various travellers. It was a coveted land. One is told of how rubies, emeralds, sapphires, and diamonds were embe,\'ed in the walls of the Moghul monuments and mausoleums creating ornate designs. Jewels were set into the floors across the vast marble. The splendour and wealth of the Moghul courts has been narrated over the years. Where did all this wealth come from? Obviously plundered and looted from the people of the land. Babur the first Moghul was a nomad and obviously did not bring it from his country. The wealth was plundered from the temples, state treasuries and the peoples of this land. It was the wealth of the Hindu land conquered by the invaders given to plunder and loot.  Even before Muslims came to India, there were wars and battles between the Kings. There were conquerors and there were the conquered. However, the wars were mainly fought between the martial classes. Strange as it may sound today, the Kings and princes observed time honoured conventions that were sanctioned in Shastras. For example, places of worship were never touched. The Brahmins and the learned were not harmed, women were not violated, and cows were not killed. In fact, non combatant civil population were never killed or captured as the battles were mostly fought in open spaces. The local population was never plundered and war booty was an unknown concept in wars and battles fought then. The kings had a code of honour and violating this code was considered reprehensible and kings found it worse than death.  However, Muslim invaders came with a different code. They would fall upon unarmed, hapless civil population after a victory on the battlefield. They would burn down villages and towns after the defending martial warriors had been killed. They went in for mass murders of the civil population and Brahmins were their special targets. They pillaged and looted even from the bodies of the dead. They raped and captured women who were considered a part of the booty. Those who were not killed were sold as slaves. This was the code of the Muslim invaders   code of their Prophet. They did it all for their Prophet as ëholy warriors\'. The world famous historian, Will Durant has written in his Story of Civilisation that\'the Mohammedan conquest of India was probably the bloodiest story in history\'. The Hindus found it very hard to understand the psychology of this new invader which they were witnessing for the first time in history. If one were to read the chronicles of those times, advent of the Muslims into India became possible only through deceit and treachery and not out of valor or greater prowess.  Then came the British and the plundering of this hapless people continued and more than ever before. It was not a plundering for a short while. It lasted for a full 200 years from the battle Plassey in 1757 to Independence in 1947. So much so that a country which even after being ruled over by the Muslim invaders for so long was considered the \'brightest jewel in the British Crown\', at the beginning of the 20th century, India was the poorest country in the world in terms of per capita income! After 1000 years of attacks against Hinduism, India gained Independence but at the cost of partition of the land with hundreds of thousands of Hindus killed and driven out of their homes by Muslim claimants to the North Western part of the country.  Last 60 years India has tried to regain its self with economic progress on all the fronts. Today, it is being projected as the \'Superpower\' of tommorrow. It has tried to forgive and forget the wounds afflicted since the days of Mohd bin Qasim. It has been trying to think of a better future for its people. Hindus accepted a large part of Muslim population within even though a separate state Pakistan was carved out as homeland for Muslims. They embraced the followers of Christianity which had bled them and ruled over them for over 200 years. All because Hindu way of life is inherently tolerant and accepts all diversity with a vision of Vasudaiva Kutumbakam (world is one family). However, it has again become a target of these two monotheistic religions. For over a decade now Islamic terrorists have been attacking mainly the Hindu population. The objective of the ëjihadi\' terrorists is to divide India once again on the basis of religion and create what they envision as Mughalistan. On the other hand, the poor and underprivileged are constantly being targeted by the Christian evangelists, converting them to Christianity against lure of money brought in from the affluent West. These conversions have assumed alarming proportions in the last couple of years.  Is history waiting to repeat itself ?
I am sure all of you are wondering why I call it \'Hell-Dia\'.Frankly, I have nothing against the place. On the contrary,I quite like this quiet  place.Its not bad at all.But, when the basic amenities are a problem, you fail to see things with rose-tinted glasses.After all, come on,  I\'m human.We have adjusted ourselves to this environment and graciously accepted this mundane lifestyle (**sob**) and the pathetic food.Its not fair enough to blame the place but it would be unfair if I don\'t blame TCS,UFS,HIT and the other umpteen people trying to provide services to us and making money in the process.TCS and HIT have struck a high-profit business deal at our cost.It is this fact I\'m unable to digest.The fact that TCS is showing step-motherly treatment to the 600 of us at Haldia for no fault of ours is something I can\'t swallow. We were told that our training is a 35 working-day period, but all of a su,\'en they say, we\'ll have to do our stream training here, which means we are stuck here until May.No confirmed news yet.All credit to TCS for their effective and efficient management practices ( I wonder how people give them awards for good management etc.. bang forehead!).Adjustments work only for a short period.
The end for a new beginning - Date: Dec 8, 2009 Location: Khairtabad flyover(over the Lake view park), Hyderabad Time: around 7:30 PM  Vini and I decided to walk our way to the end of the flyover from Prasads Multiplex after watching the Arya-2 movie.\'Movie antha pichollene babu!... Arya-2, \'veedu pe,\'a psycho\' ani pettalsindhi tag line... nene gani Ajay or Geeta  place lo unte epatiki aa Arya gadini champesi prashantanga jail lo batikesedanni!\'and so we went on laughing over our silly jokes( no wonder we enjoyed the craziness of the movie) as we slowly walked down the footpath. It was just like one of those walks we have whenever we meet.. catchin up with each other.. laugh-chattin over everythin from earth to sky(n beyond too ;))..our lives..our plans...our future. For me, this walk though, was a special one. It marked the logical end of carefree lives we\'ve enjoyed so far. Few days hence we were to enter one of the most crucial moments of our lives. Both of us were equally apprehensive and tensed.\'I\'m sure u\'ll make it..sometimes ur frens kno more abt u than urself\'said Vini .. and I was sure that she would make it. Not knowing what would be the result of influence of external factors upon our future, somewhere inside we were guided by small amount of internal factor- faith.  Date: Dec 18, 2009 Location: Sastra University, Thanjavur Time: around 3 PM  Its been a little less than 2 hrs since the probable candidates have assembled in the JVC auditorium. Half an hour has turned into another 15 mins.. n 15 mins.. to 15 more minutes and so on. Unable to think of a better way to pass time..I gave a glance over the faces of people. Some looked anxious... some looked dehydrated.. some looked exited.. and few others trying to crack jokes and laugh to overcome the tension ( i was one among them ;) ). Nonetheless, everyone looked like the candidate who would make it. Watever little confidence i had was beginning to fade away. My head was turning into a pool of negative thoughts. I turned my head away and started adorin the walls and the ceiling. There was yet no word  from the authorities.  Meanwhile semester results were declared and not many seemed to care much (i\'m the first person here :D ).. except a few who were worried if they got a 10 or 9.99 :P . In order not to realise time.. I started blabbering to my friend n almost told the history of AP since independence to 2 of my friends one after the other( Poor they!) Still  no word! This was heights! Finally, after sometime.. one of staff members came in n told us that the numbers were very good. Huh! wat a relief! Then slowly, one by one, these guys started coming in. There were rounds n rounds of applause n standin ovations to each n every person who came in (just imagine the trauma we went through). For the next 15 mins.. all i remember was clapping for every sentence they uttered. Then came the final moment. Names were being called out branch wise and  CSE came somewhere in... i  don remember where it came! too tensed to notice that.. but it came. Thankfully, the order of names was something which we knew and I was waiting with fingers crossed. A few names later....\'Geethanjali M\'.. there came the most beautiful name at the moment. I realised the importance of a person\'s name that time ;). The longest 3 hr wait was over.  Date: Dec 19, 2009 Location: Koyambedu, Chennai Time: around 8:30 PM  After a long bus journey, I boarded another bus to Hyderabad.\'The number u r tryin to reach is currently unavailable... blah.... blah.....\'.. I tried a couple of times but the automated voice kept irritating. It was Vini\'s big day. I called her house n learnt that aunty was in the same situation. After sometime , i called her again n this time she picked it up. Me-\'hello\'...Vini-\'hamma, i got through\'.   Date: Dec 21,2009 Location: Khairtabad flyover(same place) Time: around 7 PM   We booked tickets for Avatar, had a nice Frankie and  started our walk down the flyover. There wasn\'t much of talk this time. We faintly recalled our situation few days back and  ufff! how safe we felt now!.Those crucial moments(apti n interview) we talked of before, ended even before we realised them. We continued our walk till the end  listening to songs and singing our heart out. But our journey, is not to end here. We have just embarked upon a new beginning ;)    P.S:  I will continue my second post in the next one :)
If trying to write a grammatically correct sentence in German is a huge feat in itself, (sentences that are a little more complicated than the ones in German1 or 2) speaking a grammatically correct sentence amidst all the stuttering and stammering is a whole other thing! My oral exam is in two weeks   that\'s right   Zwei Woche ! Writing in german is easier because you know the rules and you have time to apply them happily, and you can make use of the famous tips they give in class ! For example, while forming questions you know that the verb goes in the beginning of the sentence and so you can write it in assertive first and then change it. Like  you have a book. Du hast ein Buch. As a question that becomes Hast du ein Buch? I know it seems really simple now, but trust me with Praesens, Praeteritum, Praesens Perfekt , Akkusativ, Dativ,Praepositionen und so weiter   es ist schwierig( difficult). But speaking has to be more spontaneous and there is obviously lesser time to process what you want to say, to search for the most appropriate word , to check the golden grammar rules. Whew! Ironically one of the methods to improve your writing and speaking skills apart from practising dialogues,Reaktionenubungen, etc  is by reading and writing more. And so, as an effort to actually write/speak at least 3 correct German sentences in a row, I am now blogging in Deutsch (or so it seems).
Spring is in the air...you know what that means...no not cleaning! By Sara on March 16, 2010 9:16 AM | 2 Comments | No TrackBacks Ah Spring.  Spring is in the air.  Birds are chirping, mud pu,\'les are overflowing and a girl\'s thoughts turn to ... well boys.  Admit it!  Spring brings a certain \'randyness\' to mind - no?   Every time I write an entry, I see a select list of categories to choose from and \'Dating\' is the first one that Jen set up for me.  I never check it off.  And I mean NEVER.  And it glares back at me daily, a constant reminder that my 90 year old grandfather is currently getting more action than me.  Dating scares me.  It brings me back to being a terrified fifteen year old girl with a bad anxiety disorder.  My first \'date\' was a lunch with an older guy at school.  We went to Apache Burger where all the cool kids hung out and I promptly threw up from nerves.  It hasn\'t really gotten better since then.  I\'m sort of a dicotomy - I\'m outgoing and confident in regular life but give me a first date and I\'m a nervous wreck doing vodka shots when the doorbell rings.  In my pre-baby life I used to write a blog that was carried on radio station sites across the country.  It was called WTF and it basically dealt with my ridiculous life - part of it was dating.  People turned it to read deets of the guy who looked like Franklin the turtle and asked to watch hockey in his undies; the writer who humped my leg like a poodle; or the guy who filmed me bowling.  I may have not had a typical \'relationship\' for the past decade but I had been having fun.  I\'ve been on one date since I\'ve had Will and I have to admit it my nerves were a little bit better.   I\'ll attribute this to my care factor of success being much lowered.   Face it, if the night goes bad...I no longer go home to my empty house and bemoan about it.  I can go home and open Will\'s door and see the greatest guy ever sleeping like a champ.            So I\'ve decided to take matters into my own hands and set up an online dating profile.  The thought makes me cringe as I thoroughly believe that \'my type\' of guy doesn\'t do online dating.  BUT - let\'s face it has my \'type\' been working - yeah not so much.  I figure if nothing else, it\'s fo,\'er for the blog right?
Year 2010 Its been like 5 months since my last post..too much..  So here I am my \' not neglected now\' blog! :)  I have been thinking a lot about what should mark the renewal of my blogging space yet again...and like it was/would have been expected..in Jan what would most people like to talk about..atleast most of the mango people...I aint no different (too much amrican angreezi)! Year gone by...  Well..I guess year 2009 has been one filled with too many shocks..surprises..travel...disappointments..cribbing..a lot of such things..nothing too great on the professional front for sure...but personally it has been good (minor hiccups but its been really goood!)  I think this year there have been a lot of \'self-realisation\' moments and some how I am still reeling under the after effects of the same...I think I still have a long way to go to mature as a \'diplomatic professional\'!! I really was under this mis conception that I am a good diplomat..but seeing the people around me..I think I am just too much \'on your face\' and its not too good for my own health I think! :)  Just some days back, we were asked to take out our Professional hats and put them on..and its a realisation which came in too late into the year, but I think we should never take them out only..just keep them on!! Even though I know that this is how it should be, I still am not sure how to achieve that..and by the way..this is my \'resolution\' of the new year!! But with the people I have around, I am afraid I would be able to go beyong a few months (at max) with this!!!!!!!!  I think I really need to work on it!  This was work..now travel...toooooooo many places....FANTASTIC (In search of a better word! :) )No further disclosers here ;-)  I think I just want to \'think\' about my personal life..and not pen it down.......Its so much better just to think about it....:)
Doomsday!!! Inspired By Geetu -  Hey all...after a long time I m finding myself a lot of spare time...so much tat i Dino Wat to do..neway i was reading this post abt doomsday by geets and i felt i shud continue on it....  What exactly is this doomsday...yeah true it is in bible that apocalypse or end of the world will occur...any1 who read lost symbol will kno abt the real meaning, or the meaning perceived by dan brown....apocalypse means the end of the world true...jus tat it is the end of the world as we know it.... if u dig deeper u will understand that apocalypse refers to a major shift - a thought shift or perception shift...that we will understand the world better and see everything in new light....  again\'before light, there shall be darkness\'...or\'before peace there shall be war\'all this doesn signify end of the world but just the shift that is going to happen.. the terrorism, the wars, the ignorance are all the darkness that comes before illumination....  Supporting this, i read sum where on Nostradamus predictions about the end of the world, that end of the world is not the end. Well, being an Indian may b i m favoring this view too much, but he did predict a major or large scale war - the war on terrorism and as it gets nastier, people around the world will lose peace of mind, and the west starts looking towards east. he had actually predicted and upswing of people going towards yoga and spirituality and come to India in search of it...and true to his words, there has been a tremendous increase in people coming towards yoga and cultural centers of India ( google n chk if u want)  for people who want more proof...okiez, chk this out... i forgot where i read it frum..sum scientific site in net oly...well they have clearly explained the phenomenon of polar shift, which many are saying will be causing the doomsday...  see, everything has polarity ryt? well so does the sun.. and earth revolves around the sun...well apart frum this the sun spins around its own axis... and it takes like so many 13000 o,\' years for sun to complete this spin.. as u see, the time 2012 is apparently the time this spin s going to change... as it changes the polarity of sun also changes.. ryt nw earth is facing the negative polarity of the sun.... but by 2012 it wud ve cum to the positive polarity...this precise moment wen this -ve to +ve change takes place, in between there will be a moment of imbalance or no polarity time, during wen due to lack of polarity and gravity balance b/w earth n sun there can be a possibility where earth is drawn a bit closer to the sun..if it collides wit sum other planet this tym there s a possibility of damage.. and only due to this slow polar shift does all this natural calamities occur.. these will settle down by 2012..so there is only 1/ millionth of possibility that anything bad can happen....  apart from this, the change in polar shift will actually change the world.. it is proven scientifically that everything is energy...due to the negative ions from the sun are our energies negative...wen the polar shift occurs we will be on the positive side and thus the earth will be filled with more positive energy.. and this also falls in line with the dan brown hypothesis and Nostradamus prediction..obviously Nostradamus meant all this spirituality and towards the east as a growth towards ones self or illumination..and hence we also look at the world in a new light....  n yeah, the well theorised and scientifically proven astrology will become wrong if doomsday is true...shudn all our lifelines end @ 2012 then...shudn all our horoscopes predict a disaster and end of our lyf? cummon people there s so much proof against dooms day to believe it  okay! to conclude i would like to say this...there is law of attraction..sumthin i mentioned in my previous post...yeah i m influenced by this movie\'secret\'..but its true.. it works..more the people believe doomsday, which they do thanks to the Internet n its hype, the more they are gonna attract it by their negative thoughts...its proven our thought have mass and they generate energy....so spread this..believe truly and have faith that 2012 is jus a change in our view of the world n not the end of the world... :) cheers
Galicia (Part 2) February 28, 2010 Because I liked To,\'\'s wine so much and because it seemed as if he was a lone ranger kind of guy, I was interested to know what his Galicia looked like.  I knew the commercial face, a lot of wine I couldn\'t drink. Gallo is rules there with its brands like Martin Codax and Kendall-Jackson is buiding a big estate --plantations are underway. I had been warned by the marketing arm that organic is very difficult in Galicia,so wet, I was told.   See the celery green part of the map north of Pontevedra? That\'s the region, the Val do Salnes.   First to his vineyards. To,\' wants very much to focus on single vineyard albarinos. This was in his organic one--the kind of organic they say is so hard to do ;) in back of a church. The spongy, healthy soil---with diviets from the massive amounts of rain--was filled with thyme and mint and chunks of remarkable red/pink granite.   I never saw this kind of granite in soil, gorgeous stuff and they were all around. To see them in the sun might have been exquisite, like TinkerBells in the vineyard. But it was as green as Ireland and as soggy.  Inside his winery, in front of the Xoan vineyard, To,\' took me through the wines, but first he had a sip of chocolate milk.    Now, he\'s only been making wine since 2003, and is figuring it out. But he has talent. Definitely has talent. One of his o,\' ideas involves that chocolate milk --and yes you can say I\'m a tease--go ahead--and that he often does not destem.  Once again, I shock myself with my lazy notes. It is so hard to pull myself from conversation to write, if there was only a way to record my thoughts. Where is the iPhone microphone for the brain?  The 2005 Bemil was extremely creamy on the nose and punchy with mandarin with a slight reduction, in a way that seems compelling, that note that I say is like halitosis--but in a good way.  The 2004 Bemil had a bit of spritz, a cold metal finish and more mandarin.  The 2005 Saiar was tangeriney and had some oxidation.  2008 Saiar, bitter arugula greeness with pineapple and the hintiest of tropical but NOT tropicale, if you know what I mean?  Notes are silly. What\'s the point. Here\'s what\'s important. He\'s in the rarity of folk working with native yeast. All of the wines had brilliant acidity, enough to please acid freaks around the world, enough tangerine, mandarinity to mark it\'s difference and a freshness that is lacking in so many of the modern Albarinos.
Last week, I felt like a real mum. OK so I\'ve got a 4 year old boy, of course I\'m a mum. But sometimes I catch sight of myself in a shop window holding his hand, and I think How did I get here? Now I sound like a Talking Heads song, but you get the drift. Do any of you feel like that ever?   The first time Elf called me Mummy was a defining moment in my new mummy status. When I went back to work after my year\'s maternity leave, I was seen differently by new and old colleagues, as I was now a mum.   But last week, my mum-o-meter hit new heights - I have finally made it. And why? I sewed Elf\'s first badge on his hoodie! No it wasn\'t his first ASBO; I dealt two of those out at the tender age of two, and there was no corresponding badge.  Elf achieved Badge 1 for Trampolining. Woody and Jessie achieved theirs too. I sewed it on a bit wonky and half way through, I asked my Other Half if the badge was in fact and iron on one! It wasn\'t.
excessssssssss - again i becam a copy cat of abhyu.... oops... wateva... had got an idea frm abhyu n writing for abhyu  dis s gonna be a 10 min post... hehheheh  excess  he says nethin taken in excess s bad.. and gives an event of him eating in excess due to parental love... and suffering frm it.  if we try for sumthin great we may land up few steps behind. and being postponement one of the greatest virtues of all the human beings (exceptions are always there i m talkin abt d lame commmon ppl hehhehe) deadlines has to be fixed well ahead in order to complete them in time on time r atleast after time... had d excess amt of time nt provided dere ll dey do it asap??  i had been to the sastra semester abroad programme for US universities last week and the person concerned has asked d members interested to send their bio data for applying.. u believe or not the first question asked by most of the ppl is\'sir when s d last date to apply?\'y ll d ppl think only abt d deadlines and d tasks ll b done only wen d case becums do r die...  and one more most observable thing s one night study before d exam  n everyone knows dat exam at mrng 9 one night study ll go  exam at 2 in d mrng 3 hrs study ll do.. hahahha observing and analysing nature of human beings s always interesting...  p.s.

Life\'s a Zoo 7 different opinions from people other than me 8/15/2009 05:05:00 PM erratically written by Ultragrrrl    I\'m running on about 4 hours sleep today, which is making me somewhat zombie-fied. A little over a week ago I was laying in bed, sick as a dog, unable to answer emails, talk to anyone, have any sort of conversation... it sucked. But at least I\'m not sleeping because I\'ve been running all over town, taking advantage of a gorgeous Friday -- and one of the last of the Summer.  One of my favorite things in life are animals. Not only are they delicious, but they\'re adorable as well. I try to make it to the Central Park Zoo at least once a year, if I can, to just walk around and check out what they\'ve got. It\'s not much, but it satiates my appetite enough to make me feel somewhat OK with the fact that I haven\'t been to the Bronx Zoo in about 18 years. I went through a phase where I hated zoos and found them to be evil and cruel for taking animals out of their habitat and plucking them down in the mi,\'le of a pen for everyone to see -- but my opinion has since changed. The wild is dangerous with poachers, over expansion, and pollution. At least in these pens, these animals are somewhat safe. My biggest concern is their boredom, as I\'m sure looking at people all day is not as exciting for them as it is for me. If anyone has any opinion on the subject of animals in Zoos, I\'m open to hear and potentially learn, from your opinion.  Anyways... photos from yesterday:  My boyfriend and I at the Zoo:  Here are the penguins. My boyfriend says I walk like a penguin and he\'s not entirely wrong: After the zoo we went to the BMW dealership to check out some bikes and then had an amazing Indian food dinner at this spot called Indigo Bistro in midtown east. I think it\'s going to be our new regular spot since the service was AMAZING and the food was delicious. They brought us free vegetable fritters, me a free mango lassi, and made a special dish for my boyfriend who couldn\'t decide what he should get! Happy Indian indepedance Day, by the way!  Apres dinner I hopped over to Art Bar to meet up with my friend John Dirschel for his birthday and was delighted to see his twin brother Brian as well! In high school I was soooo in love with John Dirschel, as were all my friends. He was so cute and looked like Kurt Cobain with long blonde hair and blue eyes. I was a tomboyish runt in high school and everyone just saw me as one of the boys. I had mostly guy friends who considered me their best friend/little sister, and John was one of those guys. I was his lil\' sis that he\'d wrestle and mess around with... and meanwhile I would dream of a day that he would see me as more than a friend and ask me out. But he was 2 years older than me and left for college when I was a sophomore and soon he joined the Coast Guard, cut of all his hair, and toured the world. I remember seeing him in 2006 when he was on break and he was jacked up. I couldn\'t believe my scrawny Kurt-esque high school crush was now a real-life man.  He\'s since left the Coast Guard (or leave of absences? whatever it\'s called when you don\'t have to go on tour anymore) and getting his Masters degree in LA and is now way smaller but super toned from doing exercizes that make him secretly strong. When he lifts me up in the air, I basically float. It\'s so wonderful to be able to see him from time to time and catch up on our lives. We live such different lives but are still insanely connected with many of the same intersts. Anyway, it was really great seeing him this time around since the last time I was with him was when Brandon called me to tell me that our friend Vinny had passed. John was a wonderful shoulder to cry on at that moment, but for whatever reason, it left me nervous to see him again.  Here\'s a photo of me with the Dirschel boys. Brian is on the left and John is on the right. They\'re identical and two of the sweetest boys you\'ll ever meet in your life: At about 2 or 3 am we left Art Bar and went to Electric Lady Land studios to visit Courtney Love who is there recording. Hole\'s songs are turning out amazing and really right up there in the realm of Live Through This (my favorite Hole album... according to my boyfriend it\'s because I was an angry teenager when it came out, and it\'s a tortured and angry record) and Celebrity Skin. They were recording a cover song -- I can\'t say which one just yet cos it might be a secret -- and the boys and I were there to be a peanut gallery and talk about quantum physics. I saw a ghost recently and Micko Larkin, the Hole guitarist, heard one sing into the mic at the studio lastnight... so we exchanged real-life ghost stories. I don\'t think I\'ve gone crazy, but there\'s a jury out on that.  Anyway, the bathroom at Electric Lady Land is super cool, so Courtney and I took pics of each other. I think this will be my album artwork one day in my fantasy life:   And here\'s Courtney: At about 5:30am, Brian and I called it a night and he came over to mine to crash and provided a wonderful dose of entertainment in the morning as Gurj was packing to move out of the legendary 3A apartment.  It\'s the end of another era.
OK, so I may have overpainted the serious and boring self-portrait at the end of my last post. That\'s certainly not the whole of who I was.  But religiously speaking, a\'scared escapee from life\'who also happened to love to sing hymns and was drawn to the aesthetics of Episcopal liturgies--that\'s pretty accurate.  And my\'deal\'with God to protect me from heartbreak if I stayed away from intimate relationships and sex--well, let\'s just say that was more the ideal in my head than the reality in practice. The reality involved some pretty confused and confusing romantic relationships--some of them more or less platonic, some of them half-platonic (i.e., from my side of the table, not from the male side), and some of them more or less non-platonic except that sex was a contested arena, a kind of battleground, both within myself and with a male partner in those days.  Suffice it to say that this was not the most healthy or wholesome way to approach ordination to the priesthood. And how did that even come into the picture?
I\'m Ellie, a 30 something mum of two beautiful little people, Big E aged 3 & Little E aged 9 months, and wife to my long suffering husband Mr H.  We live in the UK in somewhere Yorkshire.  I\'m currently on the last few weeks of my maternity leave, and am loving being a second time mum, although no-one told me it\'d be this much like hard work. They\'re worth every sleepless night!  I\'m an ëexperimental\' cook and Jamie Oliver fan (if you haven\'t got his Ministry of Food book go get it!), love reading but don\'t get much chance, which is probably a good thing as I currently have the concentration span of a potato. I\'m also enjoying trying my hand at writing (\'tis quite cathartic you know), I\'m Twitter a,\'icted and love, love, love blogging.  I used to paint in a former life when I was an art student (my favourite artist is Degas) and randomly took up knitting when I was pregnant with Little E (I\'m actually quite good!).

2 New Teeth, Crawling, and Self-Pacifier-Weaning How\'s that for a title?  Eli finally cut his 2 top front teeth this past week. They\'d been bumps there forever and they finally made their way through. Can I tell you how hard it is to catch those two little teeth on camera though? Very hard. This is as close as I got: And yes, Jeremy is holding him upside down so I could get this. Luckily Eli thought that was a blast. The left one came in first and a couple days later, the right one joined in. Very exciting. And it looks like there are several more also on their way. Fun fun!  Next up: crawling. Eli took his first few real forward crawls today (crawls? they\'re not steps; i don\'t know what you call them). He\'s been scooting, rolling, army crawling, getting on his hands and knees, going backward, and so forth, but today we saw the first glimpses of the real deal. He takes a few crawls (again, that sounds so weird) and then drops to his tummy again for the army crawl, but I\'m sure he will be crawling the length of our house in no time. :) I managed to catch a bit of it on video (please ignore my encouraging sounds - I hate hearing myself on video, but I forget to shut my mouth when I press record; and it\'s really short because I ran out of memory).   And last but not least...no more pacifier! At least I think so. It seems like I got off way too easy, so I\'m not sure if we\'ve really seen the end of it here, but it appears so. I usually only would give Eli his pacifier when he went to sleep and when we were at church (they should call it a\'muter\'); oh, and sometimes when I teach lessons. Anyway, but lately he has refused it at bed time so I just stopped giving it to him and he hasn\'t seemed to miss it at all! I was planning on trying to wean him from it soon anyway, but I certainly didn\'t think it would be this easy. Here\'s hoping it\'s really over! I should just throw them away and then it really will be over...hmm. We\'ll see.  So that\'s the update! This boy\'s changing fast! He pulls himself up to stand a lot now too. It\'s so fun to see him growing up. He\'ll be running around by the time the warm summer weather gets here. Yea!!!
This is my studio. Not just another room in the house. It holds all that is me. My studio is both my consolation and refuge. It is here, that I am me. My feelings, my fantasies, my emotions are buried in these paintings. All my desires are entombed here, suffocated in this very room. I acknowledge them when I am inside the studio and leave them behind when I leave. It happens to be a convenient arrangement for someone with a detached and troubled personality as I. For days, I forget to even eat and remain within this room. No, it doesn\'t confine or restrict me. It is outside these four walls that I feel confined. I have to be someone else. I have to act like the someone else people expect me to be. Rather strange, but when I am working in my studio, I feel in control. I am aware of my feelings and I am in touch with my inner self. Is this what they call Nirvana? Yes, I have found my true love. My studio. Warning: Doesn\'t have anything to do with me. I am only as artistic and nimble as a chicken.
God Save The Queen If I seem a little quiet lately, not as chatty, not posting on other people\'s blogs as much as usual, it\'s because March is a tough month. 27 years ago, March started out great with the birth of my daughter, then it quickly went down hill when my husband died 11 days later. Today\'s his birthday, in fact. He\'d have been 51.   It doesn\'t help that right now I\'m \'Emily\' and \'Shawna\' on bogus diet websites that use my before and after photos (and photos of my grandchildren!!) and a fabricated story that I used colon cleanses, resveritrol and acai berries to lose weight. You know and I know that isn\'t true, but there are thousands of folks who see my before and after photos on those sites and think it\'s really how I did it. And they\'re getting ripped off because of it. Pardon my language, but this really pisses me off.  When I was a kid, I rarely stuck up for myself. I allowed people to say some pretty cruel things about me or my beliefs without me putting up much of a defense. I\'d defend my friends, and when I had children, I was always their protector, but when it came to me, it was like I didn\'t matter.   When I took on the task of losing weight, I never imagined so many inner demons would line up to fight to justify their existence in my life, and lately the more I meditate, the more I realize the ways I remain the queen of acquiescence.   The folks who stole my image to make a profit are no different than the boys who called me fat, the girls who threatened to not be my friend if I didn\'t give them candy from my dad\'s store, or even my ex-husband (not the one who died) who tossed me around a time or two. They are all bullies, and ignoring them   which was always the advice I got   didn\'t make them go away.   It\'s ironic that my weight is the crux of the issue with my cyber bullies, only the problem now is that it\'s expensive to take on these bullies. Words   at least ones sent by me   aren\'t enough. I had to hire an attorney to fight these jerks, but two of the sites are based in the UK and so my new BFF (or rather, bloke) will probably be an attorney in London who is an associate of my attorney in Pittsburgh. Helluva time to have gone to a cash-only budget, eh?  Most of us at some point have encountered bullies. I\'m curious who yours are and how you handled them. Did your weight hold you back? Where do you find your confidence?  March sucks, and I\'ll probably cry about this later tonight. I might even scream into my pillow. But know that I really appreciate you listening.
After migrating to Singapore and living in a world sans TV, if there\'s one thing I miss about the small screen, it\'s got to be the advertisements! My love for Indian ads started out when I was a very small and rather annoying kid. I was hyper all the time. And I used to play this game called \'Guess the Adu\' with my dad. It was pretty simple. Basically, when an advertisement began we had to guess the brand/product before it got announced in the ad, and whoever guessed it right first got 1 point. The first person to reach 10 points was the winner. I used to win all the time of course. (Truth is, my dad would play the game primarily to shut me up. Perhaps the fact that I threw tantrums when I lost also had something to do with my successive victories.) I\'ve always found advertisements very attractive and fascinating. I even surf channels looking for new commercials. There are awfully creative ads (Saint  Gobain types) and there are some really stupid silly ones, which nevertheless, I enjoy laughing at. Then there are the oh-so-cute ones (like the Hutch puppy) and the jingles (Titan, Airtel, Doodh Doodh). There are also patriotic (Lead India)and for-a-cause ads(Aaj Tak). Ads with megahuge brand ambassadors, witty taglines, stupid taglines, no taglines and periodically changing taglines.  When I sit and think about old commercials now, I noticed I am able to recall the absolutely lame and inane ones as easily as the witty ones. For instance, I loved \'Illathin yezhil vannam\' ; the well-known jingle by Nerolac. I didn\'t really enjoy the one by Nirma: \'Washing Powder Nirma\'. Yet that\'s what came to my mind first. :O
Summer vacations are nothing new.. I ve been enjoying them every year. But this time it was different. That was because holidays after twelfth boards is like a never ending pit filled with one element - Boredom. But i realised one thing this summer. Dogs are the best companions of man! I spent all my time pampering two of the most adorable dogs in the world. They re Jeeves and Billiken. Though it was a little irritating now and then , i thoroughly enjoyed myself . They both walked into my lives as mere street dogs but now they mean more than anything else to me. One fine January morning , i spotted a white and brown dog sleeping under a two-wheeler. It looked so much like \'Shengu\' ( Our old dog who left us sobbing on the 20th of November, 2005) . We started feeding him and officially accepted him as a part of our family. I was quite obsessed with P.G.Wodehouse\'s books then , so i named him Jeeves .
Colors aren\'t always the best thing to happen! It is often their absence which holds more promises to me. Colors, with their exuberance and fulfillment, are more intoxicating than is the serene sense of being colorless. The tangles that colors often tie me in bring about hopes and expectations which I am often not capable to meet. The more spectral hues cause higher degrees of trauma to surround me in a state of clinching fear. It is a state of crisis I go through on knowing that the absence of colors is no where near. Getting routinely habitual hues can be disturbing to a stable mental state of thoughts.  Religiously being exposed to such luxury is instantly welcomed with open arms. But, only till that instant when you don\'t lose your self to the comfort of not knowing yourself. Accepted in the initial stage, this unfamiliarity tends to be damaging with gradual effect. The only hopes that I then hold are the subtle recovery of my stability to support me enough to know myself further and better. And that is where the colorlessness seems more attractive than ever before!
Dinner News We cooked our first chicken....and no I don\'t have any pictures. My husband said it was time to get rid of a few roosters. He has experience in this, so he just jumped right in and started with\'crooked tail.\'I told my family not to name the chickens, but some of them ended up with names anyway. Crooked tail was one that they incubated themselves. Something must have gone wrong in the egg turning department. He was crooked, he had a crooked tail (hence the name), he crowed crooked, he walked crooked, and a crooked breast bone. My kids unfortunately went outside at a bad time. Ben came in and said\'I am mad at dad!\'I tried to explain to him why it was happening, he responded\'I am x-ing your words mom\'Good thing I am not an Internet site to be x-ed off. They were both very upset but eventually they calmed down. I was very surprised at how little meat was on this chicken, not enough for dinner. The children have refused to eat any. I never thought that raising animals would encourage my children to become vegetarians. Time will only tell. I have a chicken recipe that I am hopeful will entice them to eat chicken again. A few nights ago over dinner my children started having a conversation about poop. Usually that kind of talk is only allowed in the bathroom at our house, but this conversation wasn\'t about human poop. Lucy was telling Ben about the nature walk she went on and some poop she saw. Excitedly he asked\'what did it look like?\'She went on to describe it and he confidently responded\'it was fox poop!\'My husband and I were trying to stifle our laughter long enough to ask them to change the subject. I never thought that I would hear my children having such a conversation. I am not an animal person, or a big outdoor person for that matter. But people change, learn, and grow. And these little people that have come into my life have their own interests and they love animals and the outdoors. Posted by Mimi Nowland at 9:11 AM 3 comments SUNDAY, JANUARY 24, 2010 Eggs How much would you say these eggs cost?    These are fresh, organic, free range eggs. And right now they cost about 6 dollars an egg. We are finally collecting eggs from our chickens. It took Jared a few days to find all of their spots, but now we are collecting between 8-10 eggs a day. I have to tell you they are pretty tasty, I don\'t know about $6 tasty. That price should go down as they continue to lay. It has been an adventure and will likely continue to be one! Bring on the egg recipes!
Busy   Posted by Sarah | Posted in Go Vegan | Posted on 14-03-2010  8 Haven\'t been blogging much this week (I hate it when bloggers give excuses about why they haven\'t been blogging) because I\'ve been so busy with the renos at the tattoo shop and also planning for a catering job I did this weekend. I couldn\'t blog about the catering job because I didn\'t want to ruin the surprise!! I don\'t do a lot of catering gigs   they are a lot of work and I\'m lazy. *laugh* Just ki,\'ing. Kind of. Actually I don\'t do a lot of catering gigs because I\'m usually asked to do large events (over 100 people) and it\'s kind of a drag (for me) to cook for that many people so I\'ve been saying NO a lot lately. Plus I\'ve been trying to re-charge my creative batteries by staying out of the kitchen and working on other things. But a few weeks ago I got a lovely letter from Robyn who told me it was her girlfriend Jenni\'s birthday (who\'s a big fan of the cookbooks) and she and her friends wanted to hire me to be Jenni\'s birthday present and prepare them a birthday dinner for 12. The letter was so endearing and full of love for her friend Jenni that the more I thought about it   the more I couldn\'t say no. Best of all the dinner would be here in Victoria (no traveling), the ingredients would be taken care of by Adam & Daisy (the owners of The Root Cellar and best friends of the birthday girl) and I could bring Gerry to be my helper.  :) I especially wanted to bring Gerry w/me because he could be my \'buffer/body guard\'. You never know what people/strangers are going to be like   and this group could have turned out to be a bunch of weirdos. Luckily they turned out to be AWESOME and we had a whale of a good time.  :) I showed up early to prepare the appetizers and then Robyn dressed me up in ribbons and bows and I hid in the dining room waiting for Jenni to arrive. When she knocked on the door I jumped out and Jenni was so shocked to see me she started crying. YAY! I love making people cry with joy!!  After the initial excitement of me being \'the present\' was over   the girls went downstairs to go get dressed up and I started cooking in the kitchen. To make things easier for myself I did most of my prep at home the day before and in the morning of the party and had everything ready in zip-lock bags and ready to go for when I got there. That way I could walk into the kitchen, throw the ingredients into the pot and start cooking    The Menu: Appetizers: -Tapenade w/crusty bread   (pg 63   La Dolce Vegan) -Pesto pinwheel puffs (pg 55 La Dolce Vegan) -Stuffed cherry tomatoes with Olivada (pg 58 La Dolce Vegan) Soup: -Curried Squash Soup   (pg 83   Garden of Vegan) Salad: -Raw Kale Salad   new recipe I\'m working on Main: -Linda\'s Ginger \'chicken\' (pg 106   How It All Vegan 10th ann edition) Sides: -Quinoa (for chicken) -Roasted Asparagus w/a,\'ed greens (pg 185   La Dolce Vegan) Dessert: -Chocolate Bourbon Pecan Pie (pg 153   How It All Vegan 10th ann edition) -w/Raspberry couli & fresh raspberry as garnish I doubled or tripled the recipes and there was more than enough for everyone (including Gerry and myself). I wasn\'t able to get a lot of good photos as the lighting wasn\'t great and I was REALLY busy making sure the food got to the table but I managed to take a few   Linda\'s Ginger \'Chicken\' from HIAV-X.  Chocolate Bourbon Pecan Pie from HIAV-X  Happy Birthday Jenni!  Me and The Girls!  :)  It was such a fun night   Love, love and more love was in that room. Jenni, Robyn, Daisy and all their friends were gracious, funny and really fun to hang out with. I was truly honoured to be a part of their intimate family/friends birthday dinner. And BIG THANKS to The Root Cellar for all the ingredients. If you Victorian\'s haven\'t been   The Root Cellar is located at 1286 McKenzie Ave. I\'m ashamed to admit that I had never been there before because it\'s a bit of a drive from where I live   but the quality of their produce is soooo worth the drive. I can\'t wait to go back and shop for myself!! :)
I had an unusual media epiphany last week, and it had nothing to do with Trafigura, Jan Moir or the balloon boy, whatever that last one was all about. No, what happened was this. I was sitting on a train, reading an article in the financial pages of the Guardian, on my way to a conference in Exeter. So far, so unremarkable. The article was about WH Smith\'s business plans. It\'s going to open 80 new outlets inside office buildings, based on the success of a number of shops it\'s set up inside hospitals. Profits are up at WH Smith, the article a,\'ed, thanks to the canny strategies of its CEO, Kate Swann. It was at that point that I had my epiphany. Here was an article in a newspaper about a successful FTSE 250 company that happens to have a female CEO. Not only that, but it had been written by a female journalist (Julia Finch), and was being read by a female business person (me). And yet at no point was the gender of the reader, writer or subject made an issue. The article didn\'t appear in the women\'s pages, or in a glossy women\'s supplement.
One year since a disaster... Its been a year since the attack took place in Mumbai... the su,\'eness of that attack left us all thinking about the status of our security... so who is to be blamed? Is it our Government, the Pakistani Government, the Terrorists, the Indian navy???? well, i sincerely feel the problem lies with us.. yes each one of us... surprised.. i\'ll tell you how.. Jus think and answer this question... how many times have you laughed recently, a true laugh from ur heart..? how many times did you smile, a smile that reached your eyes? how many times did you engage in some activity with passion? how many times did you do something which gave you real happiness? how many people have felt happy because you\'re in their life? did you actually make a positive difference to anyone\'s life in the recent past? Scan your thoughts and tell me whether you think more of positive thoughts or negative ones? I\'m sure most of the people around will have unsatisfactory answers to the above questions... There\'s a serious problem with our lifestyle, we care for nothing and no one, we just think of the work we have, our ambitions, our problems, nothin else.. we are so wrapped in ourselves to even think of others- our family, our friends, our near and dear ones... leave alone the society and the nation... There\'s no spirit of living anywhere... its only survival of the fittest... a rat race where all of us are competing... some of us without even realising why we are here and some are left wondering whether they even belong to this world... so how does all this relate to the title of this post???( i hear you asking:) ) wat do you when u r irritated on a day? u show that irritation towards someone else.. and that someone to somebody else.. This continues as a reaction.. and as you might have read in thermodynamics(even if you haven\'t), the disorder in the universe keeps increasing.. and hence all the anger keeps a,\'ing up and then when its too much it jus shows up somewhere.. you are wondering wat i\'m probably blabbering, but that\'s how it is.. the earth, nature and the whole universe perform and respond to our emotions through events...:) You might have noticed that positive things happen to you when you\'re happy and wen u r already angry, something keeps happening to make it worse... So, the anger and contempt and indifference we have built around us, that which surrounds us like a second skin is what is making the world respond to us with hatred...  What do we do about it..? I\'m definitely not going to preach about humanity and compassion... We need a renaissance, a change within ourselves, a change in our attitude, our perception, the way we look at the world... We need more positivity in our thinking... passion and purpose for all our actions... love towards all our fellow beings.. admiration towards nature...and contentment in our heart.......... If each one of us were to follow this, all hatred would vanish and the world would be a much better place to live in...
An evening in London Venue   Bromley South, Kent Kent is a home county for London. 7 such counties surrounding London have been identified as Home Counties which constitute some kind of a Greater London. It is similar to having a National Capital Region in India. London lies in the South East of England.   Craig: British from Preston, Lancashire (It\'s the same county for Manchester). Lancashire is in North West England. The size of this island (including Ireland) is quite small; it ranks 78 on the list of countries sorted by area. The distance between Preston and London is somewhere between 200-300miles. The distance between Agra and Lucknow is 225miles. The reason for giving all these statistics in Craig\'s introduction is that Craig very deeply felt that people in the North West are far better than the people in South East. I was amazed at how difference could arise within a matter of couple of 100 miles. A distance which is hardly significant in a country as large as India.  Craig quite openly expressed how ëup in the north\' people think logically where as in the South they are so illogical. ëIt is so difficult to make them understand\'. As an outsider I can never imagine one English man to be less logical than another just because he is from down South. He had been completely stressed out by the London Tube (which can be bewildering for any first timer I must admit) and almost cursed the City.  The entire ordeal seemed to be worsened by the fact that it was a sunny day at 19 degrees. He was red and sweating (like a pig?). I was quite suspicious of his several sneezes due to spreading Swine Flu.  He must have been in his late thirties and looked like one of the many victims of recession in this country. Though his demeanour was nothing like a victim. He tried to assert himself and tried to make his presence felt by asking for adjusting the air conditioning of all the rooms we were taken to, water and tea. He mentioned how much he had been working on the tests and could solve any problems thanks to his logical thinking. Even between tests he felt necessary to announce how he did so well and that it was so simple if you could just think logically. This could well be an animated effort from the numerous videos on internet telling you to be at ease and confident about yourself at assessment centres. My reaction to him ranged from pity for he had to come to a graduate recruitment to ëplease shun this attitude\'.  Imran: I cannot comment on his nationality. Reason being he had come to England as a to,\'ler perhaps from Pakistan. He was also from Manchester, but a different Uni. I had seen him outside the venue sceptical of entering the building. Finally when he did come inside and I tried to give him a smile but he was clearly quite uneasy and started looking in a different direction after a sheepish smile. It took another boy and 10 minutes to finally get him to tell his whereabouts. I think his appearance needs to be described here for the sole reason that it was a big part of his personality (and I doubt, his existence). He wore large glasses in an outdated frame. He had longish hair forcibly combed backwards to appear clean. He had a beard which was jet black in colour and went way down his chin. His suit gave away the fact that it was borrowed from a healthy, taller person as he was extremely thin. He was evidently a little withdrawn from other candidates and had been looking for a job for more than a year now.  I didn\'t get to spend much time with him as we were divided into different groups. But as soon we were taken for the first test he folded his trousers up to reveal his mismatched socks and ankles. I do not understand this habit/requirement of Islamic dressing but it did feel a little awkward to do so in a formal environment while wearing a suit.  Imran was a kind of person whom you feel like knowing about because some how he seemed to have held so much behind those glasses and the beard.  Chaitanya: Fellow Indian from a remote place at 4 hours distance from London. I am yet to familiarise myself with the naming conventions for places in England. There is a Salford in Manchester, so I am not sure if there could be a different Salfordshire County somewhere in the South.  I saw him too, outside the venue. He sat under a tree waiting for the time to go in. I believe both of us had arrived a tad too early for British standards (You got to be on time, not a minute before not a minute late).  I suspect he made an effort to exchange a smile before going in but I escaped behind my red book. Chaitanya is from Hyderabad, AP (I can tell a Hyderabadi from a distance fairly accurately:)). He saw my name on the visitor\'s books and started the conversation. He was pleasant to talk to and frankly made me ease out a bit. However during the group activity though he was unexpectedly passive. I deliberately tried to include him in the discussion on 2 occasions which I think he took pretty well.  At the end of the day we left the building together asking each other to be in touch. (Just a casual British pleasantry to exchange) Chaitanya is pursuing an MBA and I was surprised that he applied for this job.    Daniel: British from Cambridge. Cambridge is not far from London. But it may take an hour and half with public transport. He reached late and I met him directly in the exam room. This pretty much limited our interaction.  Nothing to do with him, is my excitement of meeting anybody named Daniel. It started well before coming to UK when during one of my numerous therapeutic conversations, S(P) and I decided that I would meet a Daniel here who would be my knight and S(P) would be enchanted by a Sophie :).  So with the name Daniel I associate some expectations. And when I do meet some Daniel, I smile to myself remembering our random conversations and the good it does to me   always :) But this Daniel seemed to be particularly unlike my Daniel. He had a running nose (another suspicion of Swine Flu) and was shivering (out of nervousness?). He had a freckled face and curly red hair. Not a fault of his of course, but somehow I feel that red hair are too doll-like. I blamed him for not being the Daniel and then laughed at my own stupidity.   Xang (assumed) and MEA (name not known) were the other 2 candidates. Xang was from Birmingham and hardly spoke. MEA (Mi,\'le East, Europe & Asia) has been so called as he appeared from a Mi,\'le Eastern country with an accent. I could be wrong and he could well be an East European with dark hair. I didn\'t have much chance to talk to them.  They were pretty much a part of the group, rather than individuals.  I think the best part of coming to UK so far has been to be able to meet so many different people both in terms of nature and nationalities.
I recently discovered that I just love to eat. No I am not fat. But I am just loving food now more than I ever did in my life. I don\'t know why. Is it because I am totally relaxed with my life that I can finally focus on the food I eat ? Hmm no not really. My life is not what I would describe as \'relaxed\' at any level. But still I am loving food. For instance, there was this simple curd rice, with Ruchi\'s mixed vegetable pickle, and mango for lunch and it took a lot of effort to keep me from licking the plate! It\'s the combination of the sourness of the curd and the \'hot\'ness of the pickle with the sweetness of the mango I guess. I\'m still dreaming about it. Oh that pineapple rasam rice with ground-nut thovayal and potato chips. Ahh What a heavely combination. My stomach felt soo happy after it. Today for lunch there was this special cauliflower manchurian that was made for my little niece. I secretly stole a piece and it was just fabulous. The mild aroma of ginger and the sweet-hot sauce with that delectable chinese-food fragrance. Faanntaasstic.  I can go on an don the bisibelabath that I had for lunch, with a side of sepankelangu fry, the spinach masiyal yesterday, the simple dal and ghee . I guess I better watch my weight.
The random stats we share...but maybe shouldn\'t?! By Sara on March 12, 2010 3:53 PM | 3 Comments | No TrackBacks I never wanted to be one of \'those moms\'.  You know the ones that can take the topic of a conversation and somehow squeeze in a cute little anecdote about their kid?  Sara - \'Did you hear the new White Stripes?  It\'s awesome.\'  Crazy Mom - \'If you want to talk awesome and white, you should see the painting that Little Billy did at school of this sheep.  Kill-ah.\'  Sara - \'Waiter - beer please\'.  Well, I guess considering I\'m writing this blog, that I\'m one of those moms.  I tend to do this most often at work, I think because I miss the boy.  There are times though, like at our book club, that speaking of our kids is taboo - we need to cover more important topics like body waxing and south american wines - oh and the book, right, the book.   The thing that kills me though is when people you don\'t know share random stats with you about their kids.  Like totally out of the blue. (ugh - just noticed my finger is totally green from some cheapo ring that I bought...that ain\'t pretty).  SEE!  A random thought like that!  Will and I were at the library the other night.  He was choosing what book he would torture me with for the next week and I was trying to hide the container of raisins that he was illegally eating.  I was eavesdropping on this couple who were reading to their young baby.  They were discussing how they would teach her to pronounce her\'r\'s\'(huh?  I just want Will to say some words, I don\'t give a rats ass how he pronounces them).  Anyway, Will wanted to say hi to the baby so we ventured over.  This led to a bizarre exchange.  Well, exchange by them to me, where I stood looking back and forth like a tennis match until the librarian came over and booted them out for talking so loud.  They asked how old Will was and I told them...and the flood started.  In a matter of seconds, I learned where the babies outfit and sling came from, that she sleeps through the night and had for months (no, no, no people some of us weren\'t that lucky, and we REALLY dislike these stories) OH and that she can play the organ for twenty minutes at a time.  Maybe it was good for me to run into them because it made me realize that not everyone wants to hear every little thing about your kid - even if you think it\'s totally adorable (like how Will now has to sleep with the book that he picked out which is literally as tall as him).  Ugh...I did it again.  I guess this post was nothing more than another chance to tell you cute stories about my kid....I better get him started on an instrument stat.
What? No escape? I thought that I would be able to get up and down if I needed to. When I heard I couldn\'t leave the pit of hell, I almost fainted! I started to get an anxiety attack. 110  minutes of this heat would surely kill me right? Well, almost. I didn\'t die. But it was NUTS. And towards the end, I couldn\'t put my head lower than my heart without almost fainting. So I took it easy for the last half hour and poured the droplets of water I had left in my bottle over my head as soon as I left the class.  Bikram Yoga isn\'t for me. But regular Yoga most certainly is! I can\'t wait to find a room temperature class to take part in. I even got two of my friends to come along. It should be fun. I will keep you posted.  I don\'t know why I deleted my old blog! Why did I do that? I didn\'t feel like writing it one day and then POOF - delete. I\'m too quick with the keyboard. This time around, I am going to write when I feel like I have something to say.  No committment. No pressure. Just whenever I have something important to get off my chest...
Associates on Partner Track Need a Plan B Big law firms are naming fewer associates to the partner track, according to a Business Week article titled Making Partner Less Likely as Big Law Firms Face Cash Crunch.  The article reports: Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP in New York announced it was promoting only six attorneys to equity partner in December, down from 20 a year earlier. Mayer Brown LLP in Chicago said it promoted 14 attorneys to partner in November, down from 27, and Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP in San Francisco announced seven partner promotions this month, down from 15 a year ago. Revenue at U.S. firms was forecast to drop as much as 10 percent in 2009, according to a survey of 131 firms by Citi Private Bank\'s law firm group. Here are some likely implications: Associates will give more thought to hanging out their own shingle after gaining a few years of experience plus the money to offset law school loans Business development skills will play a crucial role in new partner selection Mid-sized firms will benefit from high level associates seeking better working conditions Aggressive associates may move to in-house counsel positions more readily Longer term, economic and competitive pressures will continue to push costs down while forcing law firms to increase proficiency in both operations and legal business development.

I wish I had taken a more proactive approach to my son\'s eating habits. Being the first-time new mom I did not know what the right quantity of food that should be given to an infant nor did I know how and when to feed the infant. Now after a year and 5 months I realize a few things which I wish I had known earlier. These would have helped my son be a better eater and me a more satisfied mom. 1. Never force feed your baby even when they are tiny babies. That habit must start from the cradle. 2. Kids know when they are hungry. So force feeding will kill their basic instinct. (It is very difficult to get back that instinct). And they will start developing hatred towards food. 3. If you start force feeding during the baby days, you will probably end up like me - always running behind your child during meal times. I dread meal times! Phew! It breaks my back. 4. Kids are not machines or\'gunny bags\'to eat some standard quantity of food at regular intervals. They will have their own pattern. We could possibly produce food in front of them every three hours or so and let them eat sitting in one place. This pathetic habit of showing some entertainment while eating - SUCKS! Don\'t even try it. 5. This really limits my ability to travel with my son and generally doing other things because a ) it is hell time consuming b)I don\'t think I have the energy left to do anything else after a war with my son. Phew! I wish some day my son and I would break this lousy habit of running around and chasing each other while eating and I wish we would have happier and peaceful mealtimes. God help me!
I don\'t know how they thought they could get away with this, said Jibby McBib, a disappointed Aussie customer.\'Just because it\'s on the back of the bottle doesn\'t mean people won\'t find out it\'s there.\'McBib said she would no longer buy Aussie products, but was unsure of which haircare products she could now trust.\'You never read about this kind of thing in the media,\'she said.\'It\'s always all about how it makes your hair look, what it smells like, and that kind of thing. To imagine this kind of thing has been going on all the time behind our backs...well, it makes me sick.\'Forensic literary science expert Bilbo McCrum believes the problem runs deeper than simple improper comma use.\'Here is a company that promotes itself as being Australian, yet clearly refers to the country of Australia as a place from which macadamia nuts have to be \'brought back\' for \'the rest of us\',\'he said.\'This, combined with the failure to name the explorer who brought back the nuts, or indeed to specify where the nuts were brought back to, very much points to the presence of an unreliable narrator,\'McCrum continued.
I was planning on a Tibetan lesson last night, but when it got cancelled, I was left with \'nothing\' to do. \'Nothing\', for me, apparently translates into:  Going for a run, getting rained on Coming home, taking a shower Emailing a bunch of people about upcoming shoots Going to a cafe, eating a red velvet cupcake, and studying Tibetan for an hour or so Walking home, stopping by the store on the way Doing two blog posts about my yak leather bag(s) and an upcoming trip to Tibet Receiving email back from people for the upcoming shoots hurray, got the models I wanted! Going to see my friend Will and his band Pure Ecstasy at a bar down the way, with camera in tow Downloading shots, making selects, and exporting JPGs Finally crashing into bed And let\'s note, that all took place between about 6pm and 1am. Solid evening! Here are a couple favorites from Pure Ecstasy at the Broadway Grill. Stage lighting is so tricky. It looks awesome in person but is killer-hard to get right on camera. I think the trick is that you just have to completely GO WITH IT. So far as I know, there\'s no good tool to \'fight\' it and by that I mean normalize it somehow other than going black and white. This is the kind of thing I can only seem to learn when I\'m just messing around like last night. By the way, I didn\'t do any color correction on any of these photos just tweaked the curves a little and a,\'ed some noise reduction, along with a bunch of cropping.  Note also that I scared the crap out of the band when I snuck up behind them (whoops). Sometimes I think being a musician is a big advantage in shooting musicians it does help me anticipate when things are going to happen but then sometimes I think being a woman overshadows that completely.
My Lentil Weekend I wrote over on Lynn\'s Weigh yesterday on Facebook (come join us over there!) that when I get a hankering for a particular food, I eat it to death over the course of a few weeks then forget about it for awhile. This weekend lentils sounded really good, so I dug out my favorite lentil soup recipe and tried a new lentil \'burger\' recipe. Thought I\'d share them both with you.   I can\'t remember where I got this soup recipe, so I apologize to whomever I lifted this from. I modified it a bit, but it\'s not originally my recipe.   Lentil Vegetable Soup Makes 6 2-cup servings  1 large onion, chopped 2-3 cloves garlic, chopped 1 t ground cumin 2 t chili powder 3 C veggie broth 1 C dried lentils (I sometimes use Ω C of lentils to make it more soupy) 1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes, undrained (fire-roasted is fabulous!) 1 can (8 oz) tomato sauce 1 can (4.5 oz) chopped green chilies, undrained 1 C frozen corn 2 medium carrots, chopped (about 2 cups) 2 small zucchini, diced (about 2 cups)  Spray a 3-quart saucepan with cooking spray and sautÈ onion, garlic, spices in a little veggie broth until veggies are soft. A,\' everything else, cover and simmer for 35-45 minutes, depending on how soft you like your lentils.   I modified a lentil meatball recipe that I found through Loser For Life Marisa\'s blog. She originally got from In Jennie\'s Kitchen. I made 8 patties rather than 18 meatballs and I\'m using them like veggie burgers.   The original recipe is below with my modifications in parenthesis.   Lentil Ricotta Meatballs Makes about 18  2 cups cooked lentils, pureed (I cooked them in vegetable broth rather than plain water) 2 large eggs, lightly beaten (1/2 C Egg Beaters) 2/3 cup plain breadcrumbs (I ground 2/3 C regular oatmeal) 1/2 cup fresh ricotta (I used low-fat ricotta) 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese 1 1/2 teaspoon chopped parsley Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste  Jennie\'s cooking instructions: A,\' all ingredients to a deep bowl. Mix very well, using hands or a wooden spoon. Cover and refrigerate for two hours or overnight.  When ready to cook, shape mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls. Heat about 1/2-inch of oil in a nonstick skillet over medium flame. A,\' shaped \'meatballs\' and cook until browned all around, turning only once. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and let excess drain off. A,\' to simmering marinara sauce if serving immediately, or store in a tightly covered container up to three days.  Lynn\'s burger instructions: Preheat oven to 375. Lightly spray a baking sheet. A,\' all ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Form into 8 patties (they will seem runny, but they\'ll hold together, I promise) and place on baking sheet. Bake 20-30 minutes and flip them. Bake an a,\'itional 15-20 minutes or until they are brown.   Note: I didn\'t cover and refrigerate for two hours, but I might try that next time if I\'m not pressed for time. They turned out very nicely anyway. I\'m having a leftover burger for lunch today so I\'ll see how well they do in the fridge. I also put three in the freezer to see how they fare that way, too.   I\'ll probably make them as meatballs at some point, too, and mix them with my homemade sauce and Shiratake noodles.   Forgive the short blog. The first Sunday of daylight savings is always a catch-up day. Why is losing an hour like losing a whole day? LOL
You may be familiar with Moore\'s Law, which dictates that the computing power of a single silicon chip doubles roughly every two years, as the transistors upon it get tinkier and tinier. You may not be so familiar - mainly because I just made it up - with Garnier\'s Law. Garnier\'s Law dictates that the names given to mascara products will double in ridiculousness roughly every two years, despite the lack of any corresponding technical advance in the product itself. Like Moore\'s Law, Garnier\'s Law has been in force for some years, such that we now find ourselves in a world where the names given to mascara have become entirely decoupled from reality. Hence Lash Builder, a plausible name for a mascara, given that the sole function of the product is and always has been to cake your eyelashes in a manner that makes them look slightly thicker and longer, gave way in due course to Lash Architect, a ridiculous proposition when you think about it,
Tattoo Wednesday! Posted by Sarah | Posted in Go Vegan | Posted on 03-03-2010  3 Yay! I got a new tattoo today!! Gerry and the rest of the gang at Tattoo Zoo have been participating in the Two Dollar Tattoo Project and I wanted to get in on the action! :) The other day Bryan did a sick R2D2 on our friend Ryan (Hi Ryan) and Gerry did a tiny ship in a bottle on Nova (Hi Nova) and Colin did the scene from the Empire Strikes Back with the AT-AT walkers on Bryan (Hi Bryan). Oh man it\'s so sick! I\'ll post the link to the photos once they\'re up on the blog. In a nutshell they have to do a tiny tattoo no bigger then a toonie (about the size of a silver dollar) and you can only tattoo with a single needle. For those of you tattoo virgins   single needle tattoo\'s are technically very demanding and are an \'old timey\' way of tattooing that isn\'t used very often anymore. Gerry sent me a text this morning of the drawing he did for me with the line \'Will you be my Mommy\' under it. Ha! Look at how cute the drawing is!! How could I say no?  I realized as Gerry was tattooing me that it\'s been a YEAR since my last tattoo (how did that happen?). A YEAR? Really?  My last tattoo was the matching \'13th we,\'ing anniversary\' tattoos Gerry and I gave each other on our anniversary. Wow. A year? I\'m still kind of dumbfounded. Time flies. :) Here\'s my puffer fish as just an outline alongside Gerry (for reference so you understand how small it is).  Here he is   all coloured and cute as pie!! I\'ll take a better photo once he\'s healed   I think I\'ll name him Kaanapali! :)  Here is a photo we took as I am passing the $2 to Gerry as proof of compliance with the set parameters of the Two Dollar tattoo project.  :)  It was a fun day. I wish all my tattoos were that easy!
Storm of the century  I know that the\'big\'storm is old news, but we have been in California for two weeks visiting Jared\'s family (another post about that to come) and I haven\'t gotten a chance to tell our story. Thank goodness for all the modern technology that alerts us to the weather with enough warning to prepare. Wednesday night we made a trip to Sam\'s club to stock up on gas and food. It wasn\'t crazy crowded because this was two days before the storm is supposed to hit. My kids had been sick for about a week and Thursday night Ben was up complaining that his ear hurt. Friday morning we decide to take them to the Doctor before the storm. Snowflakes started to fall as we pulled into the parking lot. It was crowded, but they saw us and both my kids had ear infections. The doctor advised us to keep them inside for a few days. Then we had to get their prescriptions filled. Every pharmacy within a 10 mile radius had a 1-2 hour wait on prescriptions, people were panicking. We came home and Jared went out a little later to get their presciptions, are we seeing a pattern? He made it home safely. Everyone (but my youngest brother) was home and we just hunkered down for the storm. My sister and I had stocked up on some new toys that we pulled out for the occasion. Friday, all was well. We felt like we were prepared. I got up early Saturday morning, for no apparent reason, and my sister was up too. She was worried about us losing power. Having no electricity might not seem so bad considering that my parents have propane heat, but keep in mind that we are on a well here. A well with an electric pump. No power also means no running water for us. She had filled up the bathtub with water and I filled every camel back water bottle that we had (we have a lot of them between us all). Then we go back to bed. After I get up and eat breakfast, I start making bread. We didn\'t buy any bread because I was going to make some. Here are the pictures of the dough rising.    I was preheating the oven to bake my bread when the power went out. It was only 10 am. According to my husband, I was freaking out. I was worried about my bread and the fate of us all without bread to eat. But I really didn\'t need to worry. Jared and my brother-in-law dug out the gas grill and the fire pit and cooked that bread!   I really was impressed. It snowed the entire time they were out there cooking the bread. The two loaves they cooked on the grill, and the three free form loaves they cooked in a dutch oven over a fire they built during a snow storm. The gas grill really saved us during the entire weekend. For lunch we had leftover lentil soup that they warmed up outside with fresh bread. For dinner we grilled up some venison, potatoes, and veggies. It did not feel like we were deprived of anything. But it sure gets dark early with no electricity. My brother-in-law popped popcorn on the gas grill, and we let the kids watch a show on our portable DVD player that has a 6 hour battery (which was fortunately fully charged). Jared had filled up lots of buckets of water and my sister had filled the tub, but with 12 people in the house you use a lot of water just flushing toilets. By Saturday night our bathroom water supply was almost depleted. We still had plenty of drinking water, thank goodness. My sister went outside and stuck all those empty buckets around the house to catch the water run-off, brilliant! Sunday morning, still no power. We used as many paper products as we could to avoid having too many dirty dishes laying around. Since it finally stopped snowing, the men went outside to assess the damage. Numerous trees had fallen, including three across our drive way. They spent most of Sunday cutting down the trees and shoveling a little bit. Once they got the driveway cleared they did some further exploring on our street. There are three ways to get to main roads from our house. Well, a power pole had fallen across the road one way, a tree branch had broken off, taking down some power lines with it the other direction, and the\'secret back road\'had a car stuck right in the mi,\'le of it. No power and no way out, we were totally cut off from the outside world. The phone stopped working on Sunday. Cell phones with no electricity to charge them were our only link to the outside world. I have a couple of siblings that live an hour away, and they didn\'t lose power. They offered to rescue us, but they couldn\'t get to us, we would have had to hike about a half mile in 30 inches of snow. My two kids have ear infections, my parents are in their 70\'s, not much hope of hiking out. Remember that the doctor had told us to keep our kids inside for a few days. That was a bit harder than I thought it was going to be. My brother grilled chicken and potatoes with some veggies for lunch. Sunday night before the kids went to bed we all hung out together in the living room, lighted by my dad\'s two oil lamps. My brother played guitar and we all sang while the kids danced around. It was a lot of fun and something that only happened because we had nothing else to do. Then we put the kids to bed. We were all a little disappointed that the power was not back on for the Superbowl, for which we had made sandwiches and had chips and dip. Then my brother-in-law and my dad rigged up a TV plugged into my mom\'s Prius. And it worked! We got to watch the Superbowl, I couldn\'t believe it. But then it was back to darkness. Monday morning the kids were getting a little stir crazy. My sister dug some toys out of storage that the kids haven\'t seen in two years. That helped buy us some time. After lunch the road was cleared one way, we could leave! Still no power mind you, but a way out. My sister called some friends in the ward that live in an apartment complex and she asked if we could all come over and shower at the club house. All 12 of us climbed into my sister\'s 4 wheel drive car that seats eight. We dropped my brother and his son off and we headed off to shower. We filled up all of our water bottles too. Keep in mind that another storm was coming with another predicted 10-20 inches. We went to a grocery store to get us through another storm. Then we went to the mall. It was almost surreal. We had felt so cut off for nearly three days and people were shopping at the mall like it was an ordinary day. I really felt like we had just come out of the dark ages. Which in a sense we had, I guess. Then we made it home, but we had to hike up the long and steep driveway with all our groceries. When we got home, the power was back on. I was so happy, I could go to the bathroom without a flashlight. My parents have a very unique house and all the bathrooms are in the center of the house without any windows. In other words, very dark even in the mi,\'le of the day. We hit the house with a vengeance, we did 3 loads of dishes that night alone and 4 loads of laundry. Can I just say that Jared is a survivor, I really don\'t need to worry with him around. My brother-in-law is the same way. They really saved the day. The story doesn\'t end there. With another storm looming in the horizon, everyone\'s plans changed. Two of my siblings (that live an hour away) decided to head to Florida. Their school district had already cancelled school for the whole week. One of them need my brother-in-law to house sit, so he was leaving. We were leaving for California on Wednesday. My dad said that if all his shovelers were leaving he had better go too! Tuesday morning they headed to the airport to see if they could get on a flight to Florida. At 9:40 am my mom calls from the airport.\'Honey, the airport is closing after one today, do you want to try and get out to CA today?\'Yes, I think I would. She handed her cell phone over to the Southwest agent. He was super friendly. His name was Eric and this is what he said to me\'I can get you and your family on a flight leaving here at 11:40 am, can you make it here by then?\'I paused for just a minute before I responded. I still had laundry, important laundry, drying.\'Yes, we will be there.\'Then my mom talked to my sister\'he says you and the kids can fly standby to Florida, to you want to come, the flight leaves at 10:50 am?\'She said\'yes\'too. The whirlwind began. Bags packing, kids getting dressed, everyone hiking down the drive way. We booked it to the airport, as fast as you can book it in that much snow. My brother-in-law did a great job of driving us safely there. We literally ran through the airport with bags and kids in tow. I am not much for spur of the moment traveling, but it was an adrenaline high. Because the airport was closing in two hours, there weren\'t many lines, and they all let us go to the front of them. Very nice! We are helping my sister make it to her gate, my parents already on the plane. My sister is carrying one bag, Jared is carrying a bag and a kid. I am trying to herd the rest of them to the gate as fast as 4 and 5 year olds can run. She makes it to the gate and there is no one there. My parents are on the plane, sitting on the front row, saving her seats. The flight attendant prepares to close the door, my mom says\'my daughter is coming!\'The flight attendant tries to tell her that she didn\'t make it. My sister flagged an attendant and they tell her to just run onto the plane. I guess once they close the doors, they don\'t open them again. She made it! Then we had a few minutes before our flight took off. We barely had enough time to buy some lunch before we had to board the plane. But the kids were real troopers and we made it. They were so well behaved. It was awesome, traveling with kids does get easier. It took me awhile to come down off that high, but it was kind of fun. My brother was pretty surprised when he came home tuesday night to an empty house full of food. He had to hike the 1/2 mile because his ride couldn\'t make it down the road. That is our amazing story of survival. I hope you all were well during the storm of the century! Posted by Mimi Nowland at 4:46 AM 8 comments TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 2010 MDAC My older brothers, who are nine and ten years older then me, often babysat for me and my siblings. They invented many\'interesting\'games to keep us busy until my parents came home. The most popular one was called mattress diving association championship or MDAC for short. It involved a mini trampoline, numerous mattresses stacked on top of each other, music, and diving on the mattresses. We would run, jump on the trampoline, and dive on to the mattresses. It was fun. You would have to really know my brothers to understand how they could make that game so much fun. We all had nicknames, our signature jumps, and turns holding the title of MDAC. My brothers would also videotape the proceedings so that we could watch it afterward. The proceedings included interviews, statistics, jumps, and sometimes award ceremonies. Well, this past Saturday it was snowing again, all day long. Jared and I picked the wettest year to move back east. Imagine five children, eight adults inside all day long. So after dinner I decided it was time for MDAC the next generation. I figured it would let the kids burn off some energy. It worked. The kids loved it, but it wasn\'t quite the same without my brother commentating the whole thing. CJ cried when we cleaned up the mattresses, it was hit. My sister even did a few dives! Enjoy the video, although you would probably enjoy seeing the original footage of MDAC. Fortunately I don\'t own any of these videos and it is unlikely that any of my brothers would post it.
DEDICATED TO MY BEST FRIEND - Take my hand and follow me to that place I long to be. Take my hand and trust my way, in that place forever stay.  Follow me toward the sand; we\'ll run and play, hand in hand. Take my heart and hold it true; forever I\'ll stay close to you.  Seize my words and listen well, then forever I will tell. Release your heart and feelings too, just as I will do for you. Trust your heart and follow me, to that place we long to be.  The roads might be a little hazy but for a moment, they\'ll be cleared and perhaps you\'ll find your way through the beauty of the expedition that\'s raveling within your heart.  Love is never promised, but it\'s worth all the risk for the reward is a pair of wings with hope of flight without all the littered debris.  Life is a quest full of roads, long, short, up, and down, but it is only you who makes the decision which way to go.  The roads may be long and winding, but that won\'t stop me from taking a journey to your heart
Television soaps have become a thing of the past with reality shows taking India by storm. Reality shows work on a nationwide level because they are interesting, they seem real, and the audience plays a big part in ëwho gets selected to go to the next level\'. Also, millions of people\'s dreams have come true with the advent of reality shows- they get to be on television and perfectly ordinary people become celebrities in the course of an episode or a ëseason\'. Some shows have new people participating in every episode, and also the audience can easily relate to the participants. These money spinners can be in the form of quizzes, family shows, challenges, dance shows, singing competitions, etc. and these have a mass appeal unlike the soaps which have particular target audiences. Reality shows, besides whether they are really ëreal\' or fabricated, are enjoyable and generate huge profits. But when the participants of these shows in question, are children, there are a whole lot of things to be considered.
Well, as you might have picked up from my front page, I\'m a late-20\'s missus living in the gorgeous Hawkesbury region of North-West Sydney with the lovely Mr.P, my hubby of just over a year. I\'ve been living out here for about 6 years after growing up in the \'Macarthur Region\'...which is a nice way of saying Campbelltown! I didn\'t technically live IN Campbelltown, I lived about 10 mins outside (the Sydney-side...smug much....lol!)...in the lovely suburb of St. Andrews. I grew up there with 3 sisters and a brother, the greatest siblings a gal could ask for (although my sibling-in-laws...2 sisters, 2 brothers...are pretty damn cool too!). I love lots of different things and always have some obsession going...be it knitting, scrapbooking, a tv show, painting, colouring-in (I LOVE colouring-in, most relaxing thing), blogging, tweeting, facebook-ing, Sims 3, Wii, a book series, I can\'t help myself. I tend to get really into something and let it go after a while, then pick it up again, but one thing I can\'t stop doing, is reading.
Whether you believe the economy is about to double dip, or fight on and surpass last year\'s sigh of relief, there is one thing for certain: consumer confidence appears to be on the rise and core industries are once again gaining momentum.  Building activity is expected to reach new euphoric highs in most states this year, and the resources industry is back at the helm of the national soapbox. Once key national companies start making agressive decisions, peripheral supporting service industries (ie engineering; legal; architecture; project management etc) always see growth as a follow through.  So, how do you capitalize on emerging opportunities and put yourself in the sweet spot for growth?  TIP 1: Review the segments primed to move in your target markets and select the highest priority that is the most beneficial to your business.  TIP 2: Evaluate the quality of your existing relationships in high growth sectors: Are they all you need to support your growth in these emerging high priority areas? Do you need to extend your customer-centric relationships? How many people do you know that influence customer decisions in your new priority sectors?  TIP 3: Consider how your business profile and key personnel are positioned in these industries. Take a long, hard, critical look at that ways that you can reach out to your ideal target markets in dynamic ways that demonstrate your ability to deliver over and above the market standards. Ensure your business has the tools for communicating in the new economy and your staff have the skills and confidence to lead you out into the market. If they dont, create and implement rigorous train programs.  TIP 4: Scan and monitor the competition. Are you demonstrating your points of difference and USP effectively? Are you drawing contrast with your competition or trying to look the same?
I had a conversation with Wilder and Gwyn tonight that was just too precious to risk forgetting. It was the most intense and lengthy conversation we\'ve had yet about our new baby coming. I asked Wilder where our new baby was going to sleep when she got here. Of course he said his bed so he could love her. This then opened up a huge discussion of what we\'re going to do with the new baby when she gets here. We went through everything from bathing, feeding, to showing her all of his new toys. Gwyn chimed in now and then, I think she really understood. At one point they were both showing me how babies crawl so that they could teach her to crawl. The sweetest was when Wilder said we have to snuggle her on the couch and give her lots of hugs. I think I\'m just dumbfounded at how smart Wilder is becoming lately. He understands so much now. His curiosity and sincerety never fail to make my heart be still just for a moment. I know he is going to be an incredible, loving, protective big brother who will love taking care of both of his little sisters.
Former CIA Director Michael V. Hayden was fond of saying that when it came to handling high value terror suspects, he would play in fair territory, but with\'chalk dust on my cleats.\'Four legal memos released last week by the Obama Administration make it clear that the referee role in CIA interrogations was played by its medical and psychological personnel.  According to the U.S. Department of Justice\'s Office of Legal Counsel, which authored the memos, legal approval to use waterboarding, sleep deprivation, and other abusive techniques pivoted on the existence of a\'system of medical and psychological monitoring\'of interrogations. Medical and psychological personnel were the arbiters of torture, assigned to monitor interrogations and intervene to ensure that interrogators didn\'t cause\'serious or permanent harm\'and thus violate the U.S. Federal statute against torture.  The reasoning sounds almost circular. As one memo, from May 2005, put it:\'The close monitoring of each detainee for any signs that he is at risk of experiencing severe physical pain reinforces the conclusion that the combined use of interrogation techniques is not intended to inflict such pain.\'In other words, as long as medically trained personnel were present and approved of the techniques being used, it was not torture.  The memos provide official confirmation of both much-reported and previously unknown roles of doctors, psychologists, physician assistants and other medical personnel with the CIA\'s Office of Medical Services. The government\'s lawyers characterized these medical roles as\'safeguards\'for detainees.  Medical oversight was present from the beginning of the special interrogation program following the 9/11 attacks, and appears to have grown more formalized over the program\'s existence. The earliest of the four memos, from August 2002, states that a medical expert with experience in the military\'s Survival Evasion Resistance, Escape (\'SERE\') training would be present during waterboarding of detainee Abu Zubaydah, and would put a stop to procedures\'if deemed medically necessary to prevent severe medical or physical harm to Zubaydah.\'(All interrogation techniques, the memos said, were\'imported\'from SERE.)  Later, the CIA\'s Office of Medical Services (OMS) personnel were involved in\'designing safeguards for, and in monitoring implementation of, the procedures\'used on other high value detainees. In December 2004, the OMS produced a set of\'Guidelines on Medical and Psychological Support to Detainee Rendition, Interrogation and Detention,\'a still-secret document that is heavily quoted from in three legal memos that were written the following year.  The CIA declined our request to comment further on the OMS\'s role in detainee treatment. The OMS employs physicians, psychologists and other medical professionals to care for CIA employees and their families.  Perhaps the most chilling aspect of the memos is their intimation that medical professionals conducted a form of research on the detainees, clearly without their consent.\'In order to best inform future medical judgments and recommendations, it is important that every application of the waterboard be thoroughly documente,\'done memo reads. The documentation included not only how long the procedure lasted, how much water was used and how it was poured, but also\'if the naso- or oropharynx was filled, what sort of volume was expelled....and how the subject looked between each treatment.\'Special instructions were also issued with regard to documenting experience with sleep deprivation, and\'regular reporting on medical and psychological experiences with the use of these techniques on detainees\'was required.  The Nuremberg Code, adopted after the horrors of\'medical research\'during the Nazi Holocaust, requires, among other things, the consent of subjects and their ability to call a halt to their participation.  The memos also draw heavily on the advice of psychologists that interrogation techniques would not be expected to cause lasting harm. At times this advice sounds contradictory. While calling waterboarding\'medically acceptable,\'the OMS also deemed it\'the most traumatic of the enhanced interrogation techniques.\'The fact that traumatic events have the potential to cause long-lasting post-traumatic stress syndrome has been well documented. Physicians for Human Rights, in interviews with eleven former detainees held in Iraq and Afghanistan, found\'severe, long-term physical and psychological consequences.\'All the individuals we evaluated were ultimately released without ever being charge,\'dsaid Dr. Allen Keller, medical director of the Bellevue/New York University School of Medicine Program for Survivors of Torture.  The memos describe the techniques in highly precise and clinical detail, befitting a medical textbook. During water boarding, in which a physician and psychologist were to be present at all times,\'the detainee is monitored to ensure that he does not develop respiratory distress. If the detainee is not breathing freely after the cloth is removed from his face, he is immediately moved to a vertical position in order to clear the water from his mouth, nose and nasopharynx.\'Side effects including vomiting, aspiration and throat spasm that could cut off breathing were each a,\'ressed:\'In the event of such spasms...if necessary, the intervening physician would perform a tracheotomy.\'While physician assistants could be present when most\'enhanced\'techniques were applie,\'duse of the waterboard requires the presence of a physician,\'one memo said, quoting the OMS Guidelines.  Doctors were also described as having vetted the practices for safety. Certain limits on waterboarding were created\'with extensive input from OMS.\'One memo states that OMS\'doctors and psychologists\'confirmed that combining the various techniques\'would not operate in a different manner from the way they do individually, so as to cause severe pain.\'Medical and psychological personnel were required to observe whenever interrogators came into physical contact with detainees, including slapping them and pushing them into flexible walls (\'walling\'). Whenever a detainee was doused with cold water, a medical officer had to be on hand to monitor for signs of hypothermia. Confining prisoners to cramped boxes required\'continuing consultation between the interrogators and OMS officers.\'Prisoners made to stand for long periods to prevent sleep were to carefully monitor detainees for swelling of the legs and other dangerous conditions, and at least three times early in the program were switched, on medical advice, to\'horizontal sleep deprivation.\'This was one example of how medical personnel could, according to the CIA, help prevent\'severe physical or mental pain or suffering\'on the part of the detainees. However the memos show that the OMS\'s role was not merely to limit the medical impact of interrogations, but also to consult on the effectiveness of interrogations. A May 30, 2005 memo quotes the OMS suggesting that cramped confinement was\'not...particularly effective\'because it provides\'a safe haven offering respite from interrogation.\'Monitoring interrogations is a role that the American Medical Association, among others, has rejected, pointing out that the presence of physicians or other medical personnel could paradoxically make interrogations more dangerous. As Keller explains it:\'The interrogator may think well, the health professional will stop me if I go too far. The health professional is thinking I\'m really here at the behest of the CIA. There\'s a tension of dual loyalty.\'Just as officials in the Justice Dept. now condemn waterboarding as torture, so, too, did opinion change at another organization, the American Psychological Association. In the frightening days following the 9/11 attacks,\'there were two schools of thoughts in the psychological community. One was if you were there on the ground you could do some goo,\'dsaid APA spokesperson Rhea Farberman, whose organization was criticized for originally taking that position. The group\'s current stance is to forbid psychologists from participating, she said.\'If you are there on the ground, you may be seen as condoning the behavior.\'Some medical professionals are calling for colleagues to be investigated and sanctioned. But finding out which professionals were involved in designing, monitoring and implementing the interrogation techniques may be difficult. The four memos were released almost in their entirety. The few redactions concerned mainly the names of the personnel involved.
Tomorrow, the Special Envoy for Malaria at the United Nations will be announcing a special Social Media Envoy group that will use the power of social media over the next year to raise awareness for malaria control in African countries.  The special envoy is made up of well-known figures from both the social web and broadcast media, including Mashable\'s own Pete Cashmore. Those that have joined the group have pledged to take one \'social\' action ó such as a tweet or a Facebook (Facebook) post ó every month for the next year starting from World Malaria Day on April 25, which last year saw Malaria No More also use Twitter for the cause.  The hope is that the tweets, posts and other social actions will inspire and motivate social media audiences in support of malaria control. The UN\'s goal is to provide all endemic African countries with malaria control interventions by the end of 2010, working towards the aim of near-zero deaths from malaria by 2015.  We\'re very happy to see the UN enlist the power of social media in the fight against Malaria. The disease kills one million people each year with over 90% of the world\'s malaria deaths occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa. Universal bed net coverage is the UN\'s chosen prevention tool to fight the diseases; it has delivered over 192 million insecticidal mosquito nets since 2007, covering nearly 400 million people.  However, there is more money to be raised and more work to be done. We hope that the social media envoy will go even farther than their commitment to one social action per month, because Malaria is a battle where every little bit helps.
We recently reported child-actor Corey Haim had obtained a large quantity of prescription drugs just prior to his death earlier this week.Despite early reports suggesting Haim died of an enlarged heart, the coroner\'s office has stated the final cause of death won\'t be available for another six weeks when toxicology reports are completed. They have also begun investigating how Haim was able to get access to such powerful medications, including Oxycontin, Vicodin and Valium.According to the NYT, one of the prescriptions used to obtain these drugs was a forgery and investigators are looking into a larger issue with drug rings stealing legitimate script pads from doctors and forging prescriptions which are then sold illegally. But it goes even further than that. Here\'s what California Attorney General Jerry Brown had to say:  \'They get prescription drug pads, get illegal drugs, then sell them on the street. You have doctors doing wrong, people pretending to be doctors, and all the criminal intermediaries making the process work.\'Initial police reports into Haim\'s death stated no illegal or illicit drugs were found in his possession however, as we\'ve learned with high profile cases like Heath Ledger, Anna Nicole Smith, Michael Jackson, and Brittany Murphy, prescription drugs used improperly can have just as deadly consequences.Haim\'s agent, who also represents his long-time friend Corey Feldman, Mark Heaslip said Corey was making great strides to wean himself off of drugs, which may have been as many as 50 pills a day.  He also said the actor had just begun work with an a,\'iction specialist. In the days leading up to Corey\'s death he had complained of having trouble breathing and had a fever between 99 and 101. His mother had thought he was fighting off a cold or flu, but as it turns out these may have been symptoms of his enlargdheart.
I just love spending the day at the temple. I have to admit I hate the thought of giving up a whole day to go, but it is so worth it once I get there. There were about 12 members of our ward together and we had family names from 2 members. We did initiatory work and an endowment session, so it was a real blessing. I didn\'t have to drive, was in good company all day and made a quick visit to the bookstore also. I am hoping to someday live closer to a temple, but for now, I will try to remember the wonderful feelings I felt today and continue to attend at least once a month with the ward. For those who live close to a temple, I hope you appreciate it. On the down side, I had planned to call Lindsey while in Mesa and she was going to meet us at the temple so I could meet Mayan. When I first got down to the church this morning, I called Ray to let him know I would not be driving and the car would be in the parking lot. I then, hurriedly, gathered my belongings and jumped in another car. It wasn\'t til I got to thetemple that I realized my phone was not with me (apparently never made it back in the purse, but on the floor of my car) . But I will go visit the Morris family sometime next week when Di is in Phoenix visiting her kids/grandkids, she and I will go see Lindsey. So, now that I am refreshed and uplifted, I look forward to the week to come. Ray and I just completed the family history/temple class in Sunday School and have begun the family search for his family. I am looking forward to seeing what information we can gather and begin the important work to be done for his ancestors. It is such a blessing.
Last week Frank Minyard, the Orleans Parish coroner, concluded that he could not determine what caused the death of Jannie Burgess, a 79-year-old patient who perished at Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans after a doctor\'s orders led her to be given multiple doses of morphine in a short period. The hospital was cut off for several days by the floodwaters of Hurricane Katrina and a number of patients were found dead with elevated levels of morphine and other drugs.\'We cannot tell what she died of except that she was extremely ill,\'Minyard said in a phone interview several hours before a scheduled press conference on Thursday.\'She had a lot of physiologic reasons to die.\'Minyard said his official finding was that the cause of Burgess\' death was\'unclassified.\'His ruling makes it highly unlikely that any charges will be brought in the case.  The details of Burgess\' death were first disclosed in a report published by ProPublica and The New York Times Magazine last August. Her medical records showed that she was repeatedly dosed with morphine after the hospital had lost power, temperatures soared, and rescue helicopters failed to arrive in sufficient numbers.  The physician who ordered the medication, Dr. Ewing Cook, said that he intentionally\'hastened her demise\'because Burgess, who had advanced, metastatic uterine cancer, was close to death, was being cared for by nurses whose help was needed elsewhere, and would have suffered greatly if her pain medication wore off during any attempt to evacuate her.\'Dr. Cook thinks that he knocked her off,\'Minyard sai,\'dbut we can\'t prove that. He might have, he might not have. Because it\'s not 100 percent proved, we have to call it unclassified.\'He said some of the experts he consulted pointed to the fact that Burgess\' death was recorded as having occurred more than three hours after the last of the morphine injections.  Cook\'s attorney, Ralph Capitelli, called Minyard\'s decision\'the correct decision.\'Minyard said that he had not spoken with Cook. He said that during his investigation he consulted with four pathologists who work in his office, three local experts and Dr. Michael Baden, a renowned forensic pathologist from New York.  Baden has said he has a different view of the case. In an interview several months ago, after he reviewed Burgess\' records, Baden said that Burgess\' death was\'no question a homicide.\'Homicide is defined by coroners as a death caused by the action of another person. Such findings do not a,\'ress the issue of intent which is critical to deciding whether a crime has been committed.  Burgess\' daughter, Linette Burgess Guidi, said she had not seen the experts\' determinations. She said she hoped that some sort of review board could review Cook\'s actions.\'I understand he was under a lot of pressure,\'she said.\'I\'m not out for vengeance. I just want to know the truth, I want to know what happened.\'She a,\'e,\'dThere\'s too many questions.\'The district attorney in Orleans Parish, Leon Cannizzaro, released a statement after Minyard\'s announcement.\'Since it is the Coroner\'s opinion that this victim did not die as a result of being administered a lethal dose of narcotics, I cannot pursue a homicide charge at this time.\'Minyard conducted his assessment of the Burgess case at Cannizzaro\'s request. In September 2009, shortly after the ProPublica and New York Times Magazine report, Cannizzaro said he asked Minyard\'to classify the deaths reported in\'the article.  In 2006, authorities arrested Dr. Anna Pou and nurses Lori Budo and Cheri Landry for alleged mercy killings at the same hospital after Katrina. A local grand jury heard evidence in the case and declined to bring charges. The nurses and Dr. Pou emphatically denied that they had murdered patients and the case prompted outrage in New Orleans where medical professionals who worked in horrific conditions after the storm were widely viewed as heroes and victims. Some close to Minyard speculated that the coroner, who recently won re-election to his 10th term, decided to postpone his determination in the case until after the election -- something Minyard denies.  Minyard, 80, said the reason he had not completed his investigation of Burgess\' death before now was because his office has a great deal of work on other cases and is understaffed.\'I\'ve just got too much going,\'he said when contacted last December.\'I just want to make sure when I do it that I have it right.
Venezuela, already under watch from the likes of Reporters Sans Frontieres for jeopardizing press freedom, appears to be edging closer towards the type of restrictive governmental Internet interference as seen in Cuba, China and Iran.  Hugo Chavez, the Venezuelan president, has called for greater regulation of the Internet this weekend, with the following statement, as reported by Reuters:      \'The Internet cannot be something open where anything is said and done. Every country has to apply its own rules and norms.\'  Chavez is said to have singled out one website as an example where such an \'open\' policy has troubled him. Noticierodigital had a post up for two days suggesting that Diosdado Cabello, a senior minister and close aide of Chavez, had been assassinated.  \'We have to act. We are going to ask the attorney general for help, because this is a crime. I have information that this page periodically publishes stories calling for a coup d\'etat. That cannot be permitte,\'d Chavez said.  Twitter (Twitter) and Facebook (Facebook) are also said to have come under criticism from Chavez, with the president reported to have complained \'that people use such sites to spread unfounded rumors.\' Recently, he called Twitter messages a \'tool of terror.\'  Chavez has already moved to control TV and radio networks in the country   in August last year 34 broadcasters were closed down on \'administrative grounds\' while Chavez\'s own lengthy presidential broadcasts are now aired compulsorily across both terrestrial and cable TV stations.  Chavez expressing such negative interest in the online world will no doubt be met with great concern by those who oppose him, as well as in the wider world.  Chavez\'s comments serves to remind all of us ó regardless of nationality ó about the importance of a free and open Internet. When it ceases to be such, it\'s no longer the world wide web but a poor imitation propagated by repressive regimes.
I have the urge to blog, even after barely surviving NaBlo. Crazy!Anyone know knows me IRL knows I can really get rambling about television - because I love to ramble on about my favorite, and not-so-favorite shows. However, I don\'t usually like to write about it, because I prefer to engage someone else in a discussion. Not scribble out my thoughts, and wait to see if anyone replies, and then get wrapped up in that wacky back-and-forth internet conversation. I like to do it up front, face to face, nose to nose. Old school, as it were.But after a long and one-sided chat with Philsy today (who is exhausted after finishing scoring his first feature, holy poop on a plate!), I decided to turn loose a few thoughts for ya\'ll to chew on, a,\' to, or spit out. So here it is:For the past few months, I\'ve had an on-again-off-again romance (or been boink-bu,\'ies, if you prefer) with Glee.Okay. I get it. Glee is awesome, for a lot of obvious reasons. The pilot alone reminded me to not stop believing, and embarrassing as tis is, I like to dial this up full-blast whenever I\'m having a\'I\'m a hack writer and I suck and I have no business doing this and I have the vocabulary of a pre-schooler\'moment. The premise is fresh and unique - the cast is spectacular. The bones of the story arcs for the first season are clever and interesting.However... about 75% of the episodes after the pilot follow a formula like this: Someone gets mad/upset/threatened. They quit Glee. Everyone works to get them back, and they do. The end.or...Someone (or something) threatens to shut Glee down. Glee kids scramble to resolve the conflict. Conflict is resolved. The end.Now, I know that some pretty big stakes are being spun over the first season for individual character story arcs, so I can appreciate that they\'re working to weave a lot together. But really... does almost every episode have to focus on Glee club losing members or being shut down? Could we not build out more stories about the characters, to help the audience develop deeper relationships wih them and learn more about them, and forge episodes around that? They did manage to do it, for that remaining 25%. I\'m confident they can continue to do it if they try - but right now I feel like I\'m being fed a lot of filler and recycled drama.In fact, there was one storyline in particular this week that was like nails down a blackboard. Turn back now if you don\'t want *** SPOILERS ***!Glee club, unbeknownst to their director Will Schuester, participated in a professional television commercial for a mattress store - although they did not accept payment, they did receive a shipment of mattresses, an honorarium for their work. After discovering his wife Terri was not actually pregnant, a very upset Will returned to school late at night, found the pile of mattresses, pulled the plastic off one and slept on it. What Will didn\'t realize, was that by accepting payment (even in pocket-coil form) he was thereby upping the status of Glee club from amateur to professional, thus disqualifying them from preforming in sectionals.This resulted in a screaming match between Will and Sue (the overly-aggressive cheerleading coach antagonist) in the principal\'s office, where it was concluded by the end of the scene that nothing had changed, and the kids would now be disqualified.Except that a short few scenes later, it was determined that the Glee kids could go on to perform at sectionals if they returned the unused mattresses, but that Will would not be permitted to coach them or participate further because he\'d already had a good nights sleep on one of them and, well, you just can\'t return a used mattress.Huh.If we\'d had that resolve back in the argument scene, then we could have pushed Will\'s character a little further. Because even though he cares about the Glee kids more than anything, deep down, he\'s really there because hents to recapture the greatest moments of his life - his youth - which were with Glee. His marriage is failing - the woman he truly loves is slipping away, and Glee\'s all he\'s got. So to see him struggle, and ultimately give up Glee in order to let them succeed would have been a nice little tid-bit of development. Maybe I\'m way off, I don\'t know. But that\'s what I\'d have done.Next week\'s the finale. I\'m excited to see what they\'ll do with it, but more importantly, I\'m extremely curious to see where they\'re going to take the next season. Hopefully, it\'s a whole lot more of that 25%.
This is a small little story about an outlandish girl named Victoria and a cheerleader named Kimiko. Even though they are different, they love each other. Read on about this little exert from their lives.  Victoria stops her car at the top of the mountain on the ledge with the wooden fence at the end. She steps out of her old, beaten up, black Mustang and sits on the hood. Victoria stretches out her legs and lays back against the windshield.   Kimiko very gracefully steps out of the passenger seat and sits on the edge of the hood of the car. \'There\'s a party at Jimmy\'s place later. Maybe we can stop by?\'   \'Why, Kimi? So all your Hollister a,\'icted friends can ridicule me when we show up?\'   \'You know, they don\'t really hate you like you think they do.\'   \'I don\'t care.\'   Kimiko sighs. \'I know.\' Victoria reaches into the pocket of her black skinny jeans and pulls out a pack of cigarettes. She takes one of the white sticks and rests it in her mouth. She lights the tip and breaths in. \'I wish you wouldn\'t smoke. I hate that habit.\'   \'What the hell are you saying? Aren\'t you aware that basically all your friends at the party you want to go to smoke weed.\'   \'Oh,\' she adjusts her bra strap through her long-sleeved, pink, Abercrombie shirt and runs her fingers through her long, golden hair, \'I never thought of that.\'   \'Oh, what a surprise.\' Kimiko looks down at the ground and kicks a rock. Victoria notices the change in mood. \'I-I\'m sorry, that was uncalled for.\' She throws the cigarette on the dirt next to the car. \'Come on, sit next to me,\' Victoria pats the metal hood to the left of her.   Kimiko smiles and sits next to Victoria. \'You like my skirt?\' she straightens out her light blue mini-skirt.   \'Surprisingly, yes. On anyone else, it would look horrible. You just make everything look good.\' She straightens out her Johnny The Homicidal Maniac t-shirt.   \'You look good, too.\'   \'You\'re just saying that.\' She scratches her head.   \'I\'m not. You don\'t really like compliments, so I would only say it if I really meant it.\'   \'Heh. Thanks.\' She puts her arm around Kimiko and they stare into the sky. \'I love this spot. What about you, Kimi?\'   \'It\'s good.\'   \'Good? Just good? This spots amazing, especially at night. Where the sky is bright with the stars and moon and we get to look down on the lights of the pathetic little city below.\'   \'I\'ve never viewed it that way.\'   \'Yeah. No one\'s seen it that way, especially your friends.\'   \'Why do you hate them so much?\'   \'They\'ve treated me horrible since I\'ve known them.\'   \'I apologize for them.\'   \'I wish that meant something.\'   Kimiko leans over and kisses Victoria on the lips. \'I love you.\'   \'I love you, too.\'   \'Why do you love me? You hate my friends, my cloths, the fact that I\'m a cheerleader, and just basically everything I represent. So, why do you love me?\'   \'I don\'t know. When I found out there was another lesbian in this town, I had to meet her. At first I really hated you just because of what you described. But, I kept talking to you and realized you were better than I thought and I really liked you. I\'m really happy you aren\'t like everyone else. On that note, why do you like me?\'   \'You\'re really cute and you\'re really nice. Like, you don\'t look like you\'d be nice. But, you\'re amazingly sweet. It was really surprising. No offense.\'   \'Heh. None taken.\' Victoria hugs Kimiko and holds her in her arms. \'I really love you, Kimi.\'   \'I love you, too.\'   A couple minutes of silence later, Victoria pats Kimiko on the back. \'Come on, lets go.\' She hops off the hood of the car.   \'What?\' She follows.   \'It\'s getting late. We should get going.\'   \'Where are we going? To your place?\'   \'Nah. You wanted to go to that party right? We\'ll just go there. You\'d be happy to see your friends.\' She sits in the drivers seat.   \'But, you\'d be miserable.\' She opens the car door and gets in.   \'But, you\'d be happy. And, that means more to me.\' She turns the key and starts the car.   \'I\'d rather go to your house. I\'d have more fun there.\' She fastens her seatbelt.   \'Alright. Let\'s go there.\'   They drive back
Thats how long it is untill we move.  We have been packing like crazy, and getting the kids prepared.  We have lots of people coming to help us on Saturday, so i think it will go smoothly.  hopefully fast too.   I cant believe its so soon, but yet, i cant wait for this week to be over. I dont want to be in this house anymore.  i am ready to move on.  I got the results of logans latest EEG, and it came back completely normal.  no seizure activity at all has shown up.  so now we have to figure out what is going on with him.  he is failing at school, and i dont know what more i can do.  we always do homework with him. he dosnt miss alot of school.  i just dont know  i got the boys school papers to help with the transfer process.  they are getting really excited about the move. they have been\'helping\'me pack.  they did well with their rooms.   there is going to be alot of last minute stuff to do. Nick and i packed all day today, we got alot done, but there is alot more to go. and i work the next 3 nights, so not as much is going to get done.  i will update more after the move, right now my mind is just spinning and i cant think of everything i want to put here..lol
God is in the slums, in the cardboard boxes where the poor play house  God is in the silence of a mother who has infected her child with a virus that will end both their lives  God is in the cries heard under the rubble of war  God is in the debris of wasted opportunity and lives, and God is with us if we are with them. If you remove the yolk from your midst, the pointing of the finger and speaking wickedness, and if you give yourself to the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted, then your light will rise in darkness and your gloom will become like mi,\'ay and the Lord will continually guide you and satisfy your desire in scorched places Bono
lright folks, it\'s time for us to have a heart to heart talk: I hate the beach. Ironic, then, that I\'m currently sitting on Huntington Beach in southern California, eh?  I know, I know,\'That\'s absurd!\'you say,\'She\'s a total freak,\'you\'re thinking. But to each his own, I say, and my reasons for this hatred are four fold: 1. It\'s hot. I hate being hot. I hate it a whooooole lot. If I had a choice between going to the Bahamas or going to Alaska in the mi,\'le of winter, I would choose Alaska. If I had a choice between dying in the mi,\'le of the Mojave Desert and freezing to death in Siberia, I\'d choose Siberia. 2. There is sand - EVERYWHERE. You go in the water, come out and sand gets stuck on everything. Not to mention that it gets lodged in orifices you didn\'t even know you had. 3. The water is salty. I prefer fresh water that I could drink if I was dying of thirst instead of having to stare at water that would kill me even faster. Also, salt water does not smell good - or taste good, for that matter.  4. There are half naked people who should definitely not be half naked. However, my current view from this floral beach chair looks something like this:
As the ministry of Partners for Care expands, God brings people to help us.  We plan to feature these people through our Partner Profiles. You will hear from them how they have a heart for those God calls them to serve. The first Partner Profile features Bridgette Boylan. I have known Bridgette only for a short time but it seems like she has always been a part of our ministry.  She is passionate and compassionate. She is energetic and enthusiastic. She has become a real partner to me personally and to the ministry... AND, she is raising funds to buy the team in Kenya a van. Those of you who have been in Kenya with us know we need a van to reach the people of Kenya with the messages of HIV/Aids prevention and salvation.  Some of you have even pushed the PFC van more than once to get it to start! Please see her profile below and help if you can. If you have a small group Bridgette would love to come and speak to them about how God interrupted her life when she went to Kenya.  Thanking God for Bridgette - our partner in reaching the lost and helping the hurting,  Connie
After more than 35 years, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, (pictured far left) and Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Indiana, (pictured far right) are senior senators. A lot has changed - except for the friendship, which has proven stronger than their political differences.. (Photo Credit: Getty Images/File)  Washington (CNN) - While many in Washington believe that bipartisanship is long gone, two seasoned senators say it\'s not - at least not yet.  The relationship between Sen. Richard Lugar, a conservative Republican from Indiana, and Sen. Patrick Leahy, a liberal Democrat from Vermont, was born in obscurity - two very junior senators at the far reaches of a committee room table.  Leahy recalled a story from a time when their voices were virtually muted in a committee meeting.\'Neither one of us could hear what they [committee leaders] were muttering. And I said, \'Well, wait a minute, could I ask what was in that amendment?\' You could see the two look down like \'Who the heck are these two guys at the end?\' [He] takes his gavel and said, \'We\'re adjourned.\'After more than 35 years, Leahy and Lugar are senior senators. A lot has changed - except for the friendship, which has proven stronger than their political differences.
Lately it\'s been abnormal to see a smile on my face, life has been so crazy busy, hectic, stressful, dull, annoying and well pissy! That when I do actually have a smile on my face people tend to wonder what I am actually up to. I hate to sound like a broken record and I\'m most positive that I\'m not the only one w/in this great big world of ours that is not having a great 2009. I\'m truly hoping for a bright 2010.  But lately, life has been full of one big disappointment after another.  My kid\'s fathers  huge disappointments in the Da,\'y arena. They just can\'t seem to pull their heads outta their asses to step up and do what needs to be done to take care of their half of the responsibilities. My son\'s father blames it all on me.. I left him, so therefore it\'s all my responsibility. My daughters father  well  I don\'t even know where to begin there, so let\'s just suffice it to say that it\'s most important for him to either impregnate as many women as possible or smoke up his entire life.  Im telling ya, I sure do know how to pick them!  But lately  there has been very little to smile about. My kids make me smile. Even if they are teenagers, and are slowly driving me drink (ki,\'ing I don\'t drink anymore than normal) I\'ve been really sick  the plus side of being sick is that I\'ve pretty much kicked the smoking habit. Although I\'m not saying I\'m a non-smoker. I\'m just saying... I haven\'t had one for a week now because I\'ve been so sick and I do not even desire one. So that\'s a plus.  I met someone who makes me smile.  It\'s all about the person\'s personality.  I adore his personality. He makes me laugh He makes me smile He makes me feel He makes me happy  I don\'t want to feel, be happy, laugh or smile  Because when it all goes away what are you left with?  Hurt/pain/anger  I can\'t go there again
Well, where do I start.... We took Porter to the ENT dr for his followup appointment on Monday. He had been having a really snotty nose and cough, and had gone back to not sleeping well. We were worried that his tubes had come out or were stopped up. His tubes looked good (yea!), but Dr Norris was worried that he still had some ongoing infection in his adenoids. He gave him augmentin, nystatin, and ear drops. Augmentin is really bad on the GI tract, and Porter does not handle antibiotics well, so we were worried about how this would go. He started having diarrhea last night, and his poor little booty was so raw and painful that we skipped his dose last night. We decided he should probably stay home from daycare today so I could keep an eye on his bottom better and keep it\'pasted\'(caked with boudreaux\'s butt paste). Between me working nights and having a diarrhea day ahead, we had all the makings for a miserable day, but it was just the opposite. We had a great day!!! Porter and I went to our favorite park at 9:00am, stayed for over an hour, and were filthy when we left. We ran by Target to get a few things, and Porter fell asleep on the way home. I transferred him to our bed and took a nap with him. He slept for 3 hours!!! He ate cheetos and a hotdog for a late lunch and then I set him up in our bedroom and bathroom to play while I worked out. He danced to his video and played all over me while I worked out. We tried to take a quick walk after my workout, but it started raining on us and we had to run home. Porter didn\'t mind. He was just squinting and smiling in his stroller. Then we both got a shower in our bathroom. Porter loves taking a shower--I just hold him with his back to the water and he lays his head on my shoulder and let\'s the water run over him. He actually fell asleep in the shower one time. After we got out, Jared got home soon, and we picked up a pizza for supper before I left for work. I know I\'ll be tired later, but it was worth getting to spend a day with my little bu,\'y. A potential bad day couldn\'t have been any better! Here are some pictures from the day.On the way to the park!
Have now received the instructions for a Round Robin Challenge that I have agreed to take part in. The Round Robin starts today. This month:- 1. you have to make a piece of fabric, a fat 1/4 in size.  You can stamp, dye, print etc.  You all have a theme to work to, and you can use architecture, culture, clothes etc as your design source. 2.  Your fabric must to be passed onto the next  person BY the 31st March, with your design source/image to show that person where your ideas are coming from. Using the random number generator this is what you have got- 1)  Nickie-Europe 2) Margaret-Asia 3) Di-Australasia 4) Deb-Africa 5) Sharne-America\'s I will email you all on March 22nd with info on who to pass your fabric onto. Please post photo\'s on your blog of what you are doing with the challenge.   So now I seriously need to get my thinking hat on. It\'s been a while since I did any design work of any description and I felt that I should challenge myself again. Also have the Chairmans challenge at Ferrers Quilters to think about. This is to make a miniature quilt any style any technique. A miniature is not something that I have attempted before so again a challenge for me. Also have a stall at a Tattoo convention at the end of the month and need to produce some stock for that. Phew! On top of all this I have a new role at work and this is another new challenge. I am still enjoying the belly dancing immensely and have (hopefully) booked tickets for an all day event which will include me doing 3 workshops. Very scary as I am a complete beginner.One of them is on American Tribal Style which is a form of belly dancing that I really like and may want to continue with.Although the event is in Andover the tutor for this ATS is local so it would not be too hard to get to classes. So, for me, quite enough on my plate at the moment
Even though I don\'t have time to sit and write, I am gonna do it anyway. Maybe after the New Year, I\'ll get back to writing. I know I\'ve said it before but I can feel words developing in my mind and an urge to sit and write is stirring a little.  It\'s been a difficult year. May be 2010 will be brighter. I know some major changes will be made and have already started...   Granny is now in a nursing home that has a special Alzheimer\'s unit. The Friday after T-day, she got out of her house at 12:30 am and wasn\'t found until 8:30 am. Her core temp was 91 and she was in intensive care for a few days. Luckily she survived. It was cold but not below freezing all that night. The irony of it all was that she had ventured across the road over towards where some construction had been going on. She fell behind some heavy brush and couldn\'t get up. It\'s amazing she lived, especially since she was only wearing a thin nightie, no shoes or socks.  But luckily for us she is in good hands now and has no major damage done to her body due to the hyperthermia she sufferred. Mom was told that Granny has the vitals of a teenager. You know...God does take care of his own. Granny was a very religious lady all of her life and God won\'t forget that.  Sam\'s better and was working yesterday. I didn\'t have time to call and check on him. Nor have I had time to do anything fun with my chick friends. We may have dinner one night this week to share a drink and to laugh together one last time before the New Year.  My wish for all is to be happy and to embrace those around you whom you love. Life is so short and can change in a heartbeat.
Haai, so why is it that when we\'re left alone, we get paranoid; thinking up a storm of all the worst things that you can possibly come up with. I mean, why do you have to make sense of everything, why can\'t we just accept something for what it is. Why do we tend to analyze situations that have relatively made slight alterations in it\'s rather usual straight pattern. What\'s amazing is when things are back to normal, we so easily forget all the accusations and bogus imagery that went on up in there.  It\'s annoying that so many things were running through my mind in one particular episode. Thinking back, I feel pretty stupid for thinking and assuming such things.  I feel so, common.
Washed scary pile o\' dishes. (Last week\'s cold resulted in a larger-than-normal pile, although I did get some done around Wednesday so that I\'d have enough bowls and cutlery to make it through the week.)  Baked chocolate chip banana nut muffins, putting the rest of the nuts and buttermilk in the freezer before they spoiled. (Yay for not wasting food! I\'m such a slacker...) I even started the muffins before the dishes, so everything except the muffin tins made it into the wash... and the muffin tins could have, but I was pooped with washing dishes by the time the muffins had cooled.  Baked bread to replace what had been in the freezer so long it was freezer-burned. (I *will* make hummus so that I can actually eat this batch.) The bread dishes (except for the bread pan) made it into the wash too.  Watered houseplants.  Cleaned silver spoons and silver necklaces, using the magic\'aluminum foil, baking soda, and boiling water\'method. It\'s an awesome method. I tried with hot tap water at first, but it didn\'t work nearly as well as the boiling water, even after leaving it sit while I had a shower.  Killed lots of flies, as mentioned previously. You know, reading about venus fly traps, over-feeding isn\'t a good thing. I suppose three-dozen flies at once probably would be too much? Until I find a place to buy a venus fly trap, it\'s a bit of a moot point, anyway. (And if I bought a sundew too, it would only be one and a half dozen each...)
Phase 1: Lagos  Step 1: Arrive at the airport. The power goes out while your luggage is still being brought out on the carrel. So you have to drag your two excessively overweight bags off the carrel while holding on to your precious laptop bag as well the carry-on bag you brought off the plane. Then you realize that the carts aren\'t free ..and you have no naira. So you drape the carry on and laptop bag on each shoulder then drag your two suitcases out of the airport. You get outside and realize that you also have no cell phone and that the nearest call place is\'waaaaaay down that way\'      Step 2: You leave your aunt\'s house ready to go a-visiting. Then they tell you that the cabs are just a\'little up the road\'. As you have sworn with all that is in you to never get on an okada, you decide to walk there. Conveniently, you forget that you\'re smack dab in the mi,\'le of the tropics during HARMATTAN season no less and that when you left it was snowing. You arrive sweating and exhausted at the car park then breathlessly tell the cab man the a,\'ress. But it\'s not over, because the bloody bastard is trying to gouge out your eyes and cut off your right arm and left leg (get it??), so you gather your final strength and revive all your haggling skills. Finally, when you\'re both satisfied, you sink into the backseat and endure the hot, dusty ride.    Phase 2: Ibadan  Step 1: Your mom generously drops you off at your friend\'s house. She even lets you take the wheel. No biggie you think remembering all the weaving through traffic and switching lanes at 100 mph that you\'ve come to enjoy. So you get on the road. It\'s an easy drive up your long street. You get on the main road, your mom\'s relaxed. Gabbing on the phone informing all and sundry that you are around and ready to be taxed so feel free to drop by. You get to a major junction. There\'s a policeman there directing traffic. You patiently wait your turn, and when he directs you and you move. Ah this isn\'t so bad you think. Then you get to another junction and you let the cars with the right of way pass you\'what are you doing?\'huh?\'my friend will you move?\'but mummy it isn\'t my turn\'You hear the snort from the person she is currently gabbing with. By the time you get to your friend\'s house, all you want to do is curl up into a ball and rock back and forth.    Step 2: While at your friend\'s house, you decide to attend evening mass. You faintly recall that it was a short walk from their place. Plus it\'s evening so it\'s nice outside. You proceed to walk expecting any moment to see the steeple. You climb up a hill. Then you walk down another, artfully dodging okadas and wayward cars. Can\'t these people see that you\'re a pedestrian you fume. Finally, you get to church and say a small prayer of thanks that you convinced your friend to come get you after church. Mass takes way longer than it used to. Your friend has sent a text telling you he got tired of waiting outside so you should meet at the restaurant down the street. WHY ME you cry in your heart as you wearily trudge to the spot, planning how you\'ll chop off his head if he even suggests that you just walk home.   Step 3: Aaaah your friend\'s AC works. You sit back in the car and just enjoy the coolness of it while you reminisce about those bottles of real cold water you just downed. Then you feel a rumble. You look around in shock thinking o Lord are there earthquakes now in Nigeria? Then you realize its coming from your tummy. Your mind flashes back to the orgasmic moi-moi and ogi you had for breakfast. Your stomach rumbles again, and you wonder why your friend is su,\'enly driving so slowly. Good God man drive damn you! As you struggle to hold it all in, it comes back to you that you only ever used to eat moi-moi or any other beans products in the evening and only if there was tons of bread available. As you finally sink onto the toilet seat and settle down with your book for a long visit, you think how this is a much more effective and better tasting alternative to the horrid Chinese slimming tea you\'d been on. Hmmm 
Sorry for the lack of posts. I\'ve been doing more stuff on facebook these days then updating my blog (sorry)! So if you\'re on there, send me a friend request I\'m on there as Aimee Olson and I\'ll a,\' you (if I know you)... LOL  All is well at our house. We made it through the holiday\'s but started off the New Year a little rocky. We thought that the little Jetta that could had finally went to its final resting place. However, she was able to be resurrected. I\'m pretty happy as I love driving her to work! So then, our GMC got wrecked suckin\' crap! It doesn\'t have a lot of cosmetic damage but the young man that hit Kyle, hit the truck in a really bad spot so it goes into the shop this week so we\'ll wait and see what they have to say. I\'ll keep you all posted! Our work is just plugging along for both of us. I applied for a new job with the state but we\'re on a hiring freeze right now so we\'ll wait and see what happens. I\'ll be happy if a I get it but I\'m also content where I\'m at right now. It\'s a win win situation for me either way.  Ok... don\'t have a lot of time this morning so I\'ll share a few new pics. Hope all is well with everyone. Loves....
For some, sales is arguably the hardest job in the world. For others, however, the adrenalin of the roller coaster ride that is the sales process, keeps most on the edge of their seat for their entire careers.  The real question are however, do businesses truly recognize and properly rate the critical importance of their sales people; and, do businesses ensure that their sales people are skilled and motivated enough to sell in a more than ordinary fashion?  It\'s hard to find any businesses in the world who don\'t have something to sell and don\'t want to make money and succeed. It doesn\'t matter whether the company is selling services or products, if they don\'t have sales people who\'feed\'the business, the business won\'t exist. So, as most can imagine, motivating, training and energizing the salesforce should be as critical to a business as advertising and promotion. Without a strong sales force them, businesses can\'t close a sale and book revenue.  With that said, here are some tips to help motivate and empower a collective salesforce.  Give your team the power of positive feedback.  Executives are fooling themselves if they think a sales force will work forever on financial motivation alone, but that\'s simply not true. Most sales people are a personality type that requires feedback. They emotionally connect with their customers, peers and networks, constantly seeking approval, satisfaction and achievement.  The business owner or manager\'s role is to support and reinforce the efforts of a motivated sales person. Without realizing it, a manager can drain the motivation right out of a team. A manager can strip away motivation them by creating a stressful, negative work environment.   Guide and support them in building their own approach Many people\'fall\'into sales as a career, finding themselves to be good at it early on. As they improve their techniques and confidence, they gradually work their way higher and higher up the food chain of a business until they reach the ceiling and seek entrepreneurial opportunity.
Sorry for taking so long to write properly but I literally haven\'t had a spare minute to do anything these last few weeks. Advance warning that this is likely to be a very long post so I can tell you everything thats been going on. I really miss it when I dont get time to blog and I find my mood starts to go down hill when I\'m bottling things up that I can\'t get out of my system via a good old blog post,silly but true.  Right, so first news I suppose is that I am now writing for two blogs! Yes the woman who can\'t keep one blog up to date is now writing 2! The reason I\'m doing this is because I have been made a patient ambassador for the transplant charity Live Life then Give Life. Along with my lovely friend Rachael Wakefield , we will be telling our stories, helping people put a face to the transplant statistics and writing a blog about life waiting for transplant (you can read the blog here or via the link in the right hand column). I\'m really honoured to have been asked to do this and will do my best to keep people thinking about organ donation.  Another piece of good news is that I\'m doing realy well on my Open University course. The last two essays I have written were some of the hardest I\'ve encountered and no one could have been more suprised than I was when I recieved an A grade for both of them!!! The first A grades I\'ve recieved on any of my OU courses. It really has made all the hard work worthwhile but more than that its made me feel valuable and like I\'ve achieved something. As I have said over on the ambassador blog, studying is something that has nothing to do with illness but is the one thing that remains just for me. To do well on it makes me unbelievably satisfied and happy. The course has done more for me than just cheer me up, it has made me seriously consider what I want to do study wise. I have enjoyed this literature based course more than any of the others I have done and am so far doing well on it. It is making me think about changing my degree subject to a BA in Literature. This would mean me doing a few more courses but I really think deep down this could be right for me. I know it sounds completely mad to change this late in the day! (and very unlike me) but I have to compromise on so many things why should I not take a leap of faith here? A Literature degree would make more sense for any acting dreams I have and if I find the work more enjoyable then I think its worth it. I\'m still yet to decide properly but its something I\'m very seriously considering. On the not so good side I have been finding myself struggling more lately. I have reached the point in my course where I\'m kept very busy and there is a lot riding on these last few months/essays. I am also struggling more with my health. I had a good clinic visit at the end of January but for months now I have been getting more breathless/exhausted with trivial things. Last month I had my oxygen levels checked to see if I required more oxygen to make my life easier. Everything is coming back as stable, my lung function is stable, oxygen is ok, blood tests showed my infection markers are fine, all definate positives......but I still feel awful on a day to day basis. It sounds awful but I almost feel as though I\'m hovering in an area in between \'ill enough to do something and ok enough that theres nothing that will make a difference\' and to be honest I\'d rather be one or the other. Its been over 2 and a half years since I went on the list and while I expect things to have declined, it is very very hard to feel you need help and support but not to recieve it. Over the last few weeks I have become very wheezy and my chest often feels very uncomfortable. My treatment regieme barely leaves me any time to study and I feel like what I want to do has to take a back seat. Its like the CF is getting bigger and I\'m getting smaller. I\'m determined to finish my course and to do it to the very best of my ability but when I am constantly doing meds or feeling ill it is becoming almost impossible (see here). Things like my blog, keeping in touch with friends etc are falling down my list and I\'m struggling to keep my head above water at the moment. That said, I will keep going until things get easier. I will do as much as i can even in the small snatches of time that I get away from treatments. I will keep on because of how lucky I am to still be here and because I will not let CF take away something else I hold so dear to me. I want this transplant so badly now, this life at the moment is making me appreciate how good things are going to become one day. There are so many things right now that I have to push to the back of my mind because I can\'t do them and to think about them physically hurts me. I miss so many aspects of the life I haven\'t even been able to begin yet. If I\'m not around much lately you will now know why, I\'m still here (even if a little worse for wear) and I\'m keeping on, the only way I know how.
Firstly, I get to go on tour with my brother again. We\'re biking across BC and to the West Coast. woot woot! and I was just talking to both my brothers over the phone, so that\'s made me even more excited.  Secondly, I don\'t have to be in school anymore! and I get to be active all day!!!! YES!!!! I mean, I LOVE LOVE LOVE physics 30, it\'s the most amazing course I\'ve taken so far in my life and I would definitely go to university to get into noetic science and atomic physics and all that jazzzzzz. But that would mean that I would have to get high school diploma...and I\'m too bored with school to do that. why go through everyone else\'s motions when I can just take my own path? I\'ll learn just as much this way. and if I have my way about it, I\'ll be talking to plenty of people who know about science in my lifetime. for the simple reason that I\'m manifesting it. So.   Thirdly...it\'s freaking SUMMER. who ISN\'T excited about it?? =P  And in the next couple of years I\'m hoping to be on the other land mass, touring around Europe and Africa and Asia and Australia AND, this is the one I want to go to most, ThE Mi,\'Le EaSt!!!!!!!!!!! I\'m soooo excited to go to Israel and Afghanistan and India and Syria and Lebanon and TURKEY!!!! especially Turkey.   However, I\'m feeling productive, so I believe I shall go sew something.  Peace and Love, my dear friends!!!
If you are looking for a fun way to keep busy, the coming weekend will be a busy and exciting one in the Adirondack North Country. On Saturday, the best alpine skiers in the United States will be racing at Whiteface competing for the national title. From March 20-23, Whiteface Mountain in Wilmington, New York, will once again host the VISA U.S. Alpine Championships. Naturally, a number of Olympians fresh in from the Vancouver Olympic Games, including U.S. Olympic Gold Medalist Lindsey Vonn, U.S. Silver Medalist Julia Mancuso, U.S. Bronze Medalist Andrew Weibrecht, and U.S. Olympians Ted Ligety and Steve Nyman will be racing at our own Olympic Mountain. Back in the Village of Lake Placid, ice hockey will be the cold weather sport of choice when the Village hosts the 2010 NCAA Division III men\'s ice hockey national championships. The first playoff puck will be dropped on Friday, March 19.  Not to be forgotten and one of my favorite ways to keep busy is indulging in the incredible spring skiing. We received another 10 inches of snow the night before last and the skiing has been superb. In my book, backcountry skiing luscious corn snow in 50-degree brilliant sunshine is one of the most fun and rejuvenating activities around. The Adirondacks have it all; the excitement and buzz of watching a top-level competition or participating in private ski excursion at your own quiet ski resort in the woods. All you have to do is choose. Today\'s featured photo shows the Lake Placid 1932 Olympic Arena, on Main Street, courtesy of Joann Sandone Reed. Today\'s brilliant blue sky, visible in the photo, and warm sunshine, made today\'s skiing obligation a delight.
Many people I meet as a marketer ask me how quickly their marketing will lead to sales and ultimately, revenue. I reply by asking them what their time to sale is and what their level of awareness is within their target markets? I also like to understand how many happy customers or clients they have created over time. Occasionally I get some puzzled looks. Whenever I do, I offer this simple Marketing lesson.  Have you ever heard of the principle that one satisfied customer can bring you up to 10 more customers in a shorter amount of time than you can build them all by yourself? Well, let me show you why: There is five stages to building a customer from no-awareness to full blown evangelist. Get it right and you\'ll only have to go through the initial campaigns once or twice to build the initial base of satisfied customers extolling your virtues.  This is the foundation I build many marketing campaigns on, ensuring I have strategies to take a potential customer on the journey through each stage.   Awareness: You must make a customer aware of your product or service category, your business and its capability. At this point of the process, lets face it, many potential targets are largely disinterested or indifferent as they can\'t see a need for your product or service in their life much of the time. This step is a hard, often cold part of the sales process, full of apathy and rejection.  Interest: Something happens in a potential target\'s life or business for them to move from basic awareness phase and raise their interest in your offering. A target cannot get to interest if you haven\'t raised awareness of your brand and offering or capability with them ó except through step five: satisfaction. This is the point of a process where we would qualify a target as a warm lead and nurture them carefully to build their interest into hungry desire.
We\'re leaving one  hot, dirty, sandstorm-ri,\'led area in Africa and are headed to a hot, dirty sandstorm ri,\'led area in the gulf.   Why?? for the love of all that\'s holy WHY? YOU ASK!? (as did I?)  Because (a) Stupid Sudan is having national elections soon and I am supposed to be here so I can pretend to care deeply about the\'issues\'facing Sudan so I can\'t be gone long; and (b) Josh is participating in a triathlon in Abu Dhabi.  -- Which is apparently why he insisted on hoggin the mail fairy so his\'gear\'could arrive and he could be prepared for his race and not die.  I\'m guessing I probably shouldn\'t have eaten his power bars...but seriously, who could have known!   There should have been a sign.  And finally (since I really don\'t have anything to say) I would just like to point out that we watched a movie this weekend (which I also realize you guys probably all saw like 6 months ago, but just be polite and pretend to listen)\'The Road\'with that one guy who was in Hidalgo and used to be soo dreamy until I found out that he likes to write poetry and commune with Nature (that\'s not my way).    Did you guys see this?? The world is basically dying (I\'m still not sure why, or what happened frankly) and that guy in Hidalgo and his son try to go south and avoid cannibals (why are cannibals always depicted like they\'re from West Virginia?  And why do people from West Virginia always manage to LIVE when everyone else dies off...the inbred people seem to thrive in a catastrophe.....someone should really study that or something.  Learn their secret.)  ANYWAY, I\'m not sure what happened, or why I watched that movie.  All I know is that I am going to hoard some shoes (?? No, I\'m not sure what happened to everyone\'s shoes frankly) and some canned fruit cocktail.  Don\'t ask questions.....trust me.  Just do it.   You never know when something will happen that will make all the animals die and
Jenni and I were driving in the car this afternoon when she began to tell me about a situation at her work. She was telling me about a fellow employee who was sent into the office to discuss some issues. She incredulously told me that his infraction was so bad that he had to talk to the (and I quote)\'SBO\'. I replie,\',\'o you mean CEO\'? Jenni:\'Oh yeah...what is a SBO?\'Me:\'Isn\'t that a Student Body Officer?\'Jenni:\'hahahahahahha! What is a CEO?\'Me:\'Chief Executive Officer\'. Jenni:\'Oh, yeah that one\'Never a dull moment.
The web is becoming a live medium ó sales and auctions happen in time, product launches, chats with celebrities, live video events and audio, games, events in virtual worlds ó there are a huge amount of scheduled things taking place,\' says Nova Spivack, who recently sold off his semantic web search engine Twine to Evri. Now he\'s setting out to create a massive programming guide to those live online events, called Live Matrix. Spivack last year brought on Sanjay Re,\'y, who\'d done corporate development at Gemstar-TV Guide and led its sale to Macrovision for $2.8 billion. Re,\'y knew from experience that TV watchers spend 10 percent of their time watching TV on the interactive programming guide (per set-top box data). The web has much more going on at any one time, but nothing like an IPG. Does that metaphor carry over? That\'s what Spivack, who\'s serving as Live Matrix chairman, and Re,\'y, the CEO, want to find out. They plan to launch in May and gave me a look at the pre-release site under the condition that I not release screenshots. I\'ll tell you a bit more about what they\'re doing and describe in words what it looks like. First of all, there\'s the prototypical grid interface ó though instead of listing channels due to preset numbers like on TV, they\'re dynamically ordered based on demand. Log in during March Madness? That\'s going to be on top. If a web metaphor is more your style, you can look at all the events in a Digg-like interface. Users can pull events into a personal playlist and receive reminders when they start. If you actually want to watch something, Live Matrix sends you to the host site rather than framing the content.
I just sent this video (That\'s My King) to my best friend and her response is overwhelming! Her awe reminds me of my own awe, her joy of my own joy, her faith of my own faith. It\'s just what I needed to keep on going... so many things to say about my king- words that barely describe him already put me in silence.   I\'ve been avoiding the monologues-I\'ve been sitting on the computer doing everything else. I\'ve been eating grapes, talking on the phone, asking help for the monologues, getting ideas for the monologues, talking about the monologues but not actually doing them.\'I think I\'m avoiding monologues... I guess I am scared God won\'t provide...\'and do you know what she said?\'GOD IS A PROVIDER, HE ALWAYS PROVIDE.\'What I need to do is: just believe. This is where I stop thinking abstractly about faith and live it out. Step one- just start. He will not pick you up from the ground, no, He will help you up as you overcome, you must start walking (faith) and He will lift you (grace) and you will fly...  P.s. God remembers us and who we are! He sends angels...
Now, these may have been around for ages, we can\'t really be sure because, truth be told, it\'s pretty rare for us to troll the aisles of Kohl\'s makeup section looking for KIRFs. Regardless, a helpful, hawk-eyed reader snapped this shot of an eyeshadow palette -- called eyemobile -- that\'s got the distinct iPhone aura going on, though we\'re 100 percent certain this is an unauthorized use case. It\'s hard to say from the photo, but it also looks like there\'s a lip gloss palette in the background (which we assume is called lipmobile), and that, friends, we would pay money for. Lots of money.
It started out innocently enough. Last week while on the phone with my mom and one of my sisters, the subject turned to movies. I told them how excited I was about Alice in Wonderland and joked that I even considered making a\'mad hat\'just for the occasion. After all, one can\'t have so many favorites in one project and not commemorate. (Those favorites being Johnny Depp, Tim Burton, Anne Hathaway, Helena B-Carter and the tale of Alice, of course.) We all got a good laugh out of it, and then the topic of conversation changed again. I thought no more of it until the next day.   At work I looked around my desk at all the random doo-dads and trinkets. I knew why they were there - to a,\' a bit of whimsy to my space, some fun and silliness.\'Ha!\'I thought to myself,\'Could you imagine putting those things on a hat? How curious.\'I came home, and while taking off my jewelry, I noticed more little things on my dresser: various pins and buttons, a pocket-watch that still needs a chain, a fuzzy lapel pin that looks a lot like a Tribble.\'Well, I do seem to have the materials, if I were so inclined...\'Thursday night found me with all manner of delicious nonsense spread out across my coffee table.\'But you love that hat,\'HomeBoy said.\'None of the changes will be permanent,\'I assured him,\'I\'m only using hat pins and tape.\'I had forgotten how much fun arts and crafts can be. Fixing and fastening, arranging, rearranging, positioning just so... I really did enjoy myself. And, in true childlike fashion, I couldn\'t wait to show it -\'Look what I made!\'The silliest part may be that I\'m not at all embarrassed. At no point did I feel like I was too old to do such a thing. To be honest, I am quite relieved to find I am capable of such nonsense.
IN A NUTSHELL: WE HAVE USED THE MODEL #22205 DAILY SINCE 1997  The model 22205 is almost an exact twin of the model offered here, except it was offered for sale to us in 1997. We have 5 children and this brave little toaster has seen alot of service since 1997 without a single problem.  WHAT IT\'S ALL ABOUT: 900 WATTS - WHITE ENAMEL FINISH - CRUMB TRAY  We have used and overused this little appliance and while 5 coffee makers and 3 \'Foreman Grills\' have worn out this toaster keeps toasting just like it always has.  CAUTION: HOT TO THE TOUCH  Like toasters of old, this one is hot to the touch with only thin metal and white baked enamel between your fingers and the red hot nichrome filaments that are powered by 900 watts of electricity. Actually, it was the 900 watts versus 7-800 watts of other toasters that got me to buy this in the first place. It even has a crumb bin! Well, 9.5 years and counting, but soon we may want to replace it for a \'cool-touch\', though I think we will always keep this brave little toaster around for sentimental reasons.

Clifford\'s own connection to soup is profound. As a ten-year old vacationing in Spain, he is taken for his first meal in a fine dining restaurant: A bowl of soup can be a powerful dish. It recalls memories, warm the heart and soul, and can use up plenty of leftovers in our cupboards and refrigerators. Clifford Wright\'s The Best Soups in the World (Wiley 2010) appeals to all these aspects of soup. His book delivers recipes from around the world with intelligent commentary. Even as the weather warms up this Spring, get out the soup pot and make some soup. It starts as almost all soup books do, with basic broths (p. 9) followed by clear soups (p. 19). The real action is in the next chapter on chunky meat soups (p. 41) The first recipe isn\'t for a standard beefy mushroom soup, but for Blackfoot Bison and Blackberry Soup (p. 42) for which you need buffalo bones, suet and meet and spicebush berries, all of which might be hard to find. Clifford calls the recipe a \'curiosity\', but he expects the reader to make the soup, even with the substitute ingredients of beef bones, suet and meat, and juniper berries. What is really interesting is that in the recipe notes he writes about who the Blackfoot Nation are (three different tribes) and a bit of their culinary culture.  He follows with a recipe for Shchi (p. 44), the Russian beef and sauerkraut (or fresh cabbage) soup that has a thousand variations, and Borshch (p. 46), along with an essay on \'Everything You Want to Know About Borshch\' that covers the history of borshch and the boscht belt. From there Clifford roams the world, from Greece with Avgolemono Meatball Soup (p. 50) to Polish Zurek (p. 54) to Turkmen Boiled Soup (p. 63). There are side essays that fill you in about soup practices in Africa or specific kinds of obscure soups. Although there is a wealth of information, the recipes dominate   this is a book to cook with and enjoy.
Next up, blood-thirsty bunnies Marlo is officially down to two naps. For those of you who do not have children, that first sentence will mean nothing to you. For those of you who do, you probably just experienced an instinctual pain in your chest at the memory of what it means to plan your life around your baby\'s sleep schedule. Or is that just me? I can\'t be the only one who has run outside and verbally berated the garbage truck driver for disturbing a nap, THERE GOES THE REST OF MY DAY. Garbage truck diver, snow plower, mail carrier... all have been informed at one time or another of Marlo\'s sleep schedule. It goes like this: when Marlo\'s asleep, no one is allowed to breathe. The end. You don\'t want that crazy, short-haired Southern lady who looks like an eight-year-old boy running out into the street in her bare feet. She may be liberal, but she\'s related to people who own guns. And just this week we\'ve managed to manipulate her schedule so that she\'s sleeping in until 6:30 AM. Do you have any idea how indulgent this feels, to sleep in so late? No, you don\'t understand. It like we\'re fifteen years old, and su,\'enly the prophet has declared that pre-marital sex is totally okay. I guess I should say, that one time we slept in so late since our other child has decided that days now begin at 5 AM. Read that again: FIVE O\'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. You want to know why? Because she thinks a leprechaun is tapping on her window. I cannot believe I just wrote that sentence. I mean, I can understand a fear of spiders or earthquakes or rats that are big enough to eat your face off. But, little green dudes? If anything you want them at your party because they can hold their liquor. Also, don\'t they all come with marshmallows? And, I don\'t remember ever talking to her about leprechauns, so I\'m guessing this is one of those rotten things she picked up at school, like a,\'ition and subtraction. And what do you know, IT IS. Turns out one has been coming into their classroom and leaving notes in the days leading up to St. Patrick\'s Day. And this afternoon when I told her teacher about this early-morning tapping leprechaun, she said with a gleam in her eye,\'Oh yes, he\'d be tapping, for sure. They\'re cobblers, you know.\'HAHA! I\'m laughing because, that is just so damn brilliant. They have to deal with our kids all day long, and oh no. Is your kid waking up early? How sad for you who get to send them AWAY ALL DAY. It\'s like, if I\'m going to blame the teacher for the leprechaun, she\'s more than happy to break out her fifty-page, single-spaced document of quirks she\'d like explained, thank you very much. Well played, elementary school teachers. Well played. That decrepit old hag This is quickly and steadily becoming A List of My Ailments Blog, and
This iron hardly got hot enough to flatten anything. Very little heat production, maybe faulty item, but warranty service was poor. My hair is quite curly and so needs straighening every day. The sedu does straighten reasonable well but it takes quite a lot of time and also the machine has a design fault (or so it seems) as it is extremely easy to trap your fingers in it while using it. I was impressed by the sound of the product having tourmaline plates which are meant to help prevent split ends.I like it very much! i like the 1\'better than the wider 1 1/2\'because i have bangs (that absolutly MUST be staightened) but it still works GREAT on my long hair. and it makes it sooo soft. and well that just makes me smile.so just buy it already. really you will be so glad you made the choice. I used to straighten my hair in the salon and it takes me too much time. Then my friend suggest me to try it myself with a hair straightener. And she recommended SEDU. I really didn\'t want to spend as much as this hair straightener costs, but after reviews, and needing one that didn\'t rip my coarse & curly hair to shreds, I relented. Well it is a wonderful tool. It heats up extremely quickly and my hair is shiny, & silky smooth. I\'m also applying Biosilk Silk Therapy to my hair prior to flatironing. Thanks to both the flatiron and the Silk Therapy, the formerly very tough job of hair straightening is now far easier for me. Thanks very much!
A few years ago Mark McPherson contacted me out of the blue asking if I was interested in taking part in a book project that focused on Australian and American photographers. I thought, hmm... that\'s random, but potentially interesting. I knew very little about Australia beyond the cliches of surfing, kangaroos and walkabouts. Since Hijacked was released I have been involved in an intense love affair with the country.  Thank you, Mark, for opening so many doors.  After three weeks touring about New South Wales, I\'m now in Perth for a series of Foto Freo related events. Thursday, Stranded will have it\'s solo debut at the Perth Centre for Photography. The show will include 33 images and I\'m nervous and excited to see how they work together. Foto Freo also includes talks and shows by Trente Park, Chien-Chi Chang, Jon Levy and friends and fellow Americans Carrie Levy, Stacy Mehfar and Andy Adams.  Thanks to Bob Hewitt, June Moorhouse, Laura Beilby and the folks at the Perth Centre for Photography for inviting me to Australia and Foto Freo. There is an interesting article in Seed Magazine that sums up recent research around the growing debate of whether animals are people. It would appear that many of the traits we have long considered uniquely human are not so unique after all. The debate feels less like a struggle for scientific clarity and more like a brainy ape\'s desperate attempt to hold on to his fragile sense of supremacy.  Instead of\'what makes us human\'being a question where we are able to constantly adjust the answer, maybe we should make it a statement and choose a definition that commits us to a more humane standard of dominion. A year ago I met Stacy Mehrfar for a drink at the Half King in Chelsea. We\'d known each other since our early days printing in the color darkroom at the ICP, but on that day Stacy was in town from Sydney, where she lives with her husband Gavin. As we were catching up over a drink and talking about her new adopted country, she mentioned a strange phrase, Tall Poppy Syndrome. Tall Poppy Syndrome is an Australian societal phenomenon where people who are seen to be successful are resented by their fellow citizens. Having been raised in a country that preaches the religion of individual success (USA! USA! USA!), this concept was foreign to me. As we discussed it further we decided it would be a great structure for a photo series about Australia.
THE ELEGANT WOMAN in the pink silk kimono attracts admiring glances from be-suited businessmen and elderly Japanese women as she walks through the narrow, tourist-choked streets leading to Tokyo\'s Sensoji Temple. The locals here in the old district of Asakusa know a real geisha when they spot one ó even if she is a tall Westerner with olive-green eyes. From her rounded bun hairstyle to her pigeon-toed tabi socks, Sayuki, otherwise known as anthropologist Fiona Graham, is decked out so immaculately in true geisha style that her admirers utter the same compliment as she passes by: kirei desu ne ó she\'s beautiful.  Sayuki denies she\'s a flawless example of Japan\'s ancient flower and willow world.\'Being a geisha takes a lifetime to perfect,\'she deflects, as she clacks along in lacquer sandals that she wears slightly too small to make her size-8 feet look more petite. Sayuki, who was born in Melbourne, Australia, became the first foreign woman in the notoriously closed profession\'s 400-year history to formally debut as a geisha two years ago, in late 2007.\'I\'ve only just begun,\'she says.\'To many of my geisha sisters, I\'m still a walking disaster.\'It\'s all relative. Near Sensoji\'s majestic red gateway, gaggles of female Japanese tourists are clad in flowery kimonos ó a new retro fashion trend. Sacrilegiously, they\'ve a,\'ed lace and frills to the fabric and wear garish costume jewelry.\'Also, they don\'t wear underwear. The geisha elders are scandalize,\'dlaughs Sayuki, with only a faint Aussie twang in her girlish voice.\'I\'m wearing four layers of lingerie under my kimono, so at least I\'ve got that right.\'Flaunting womanly curves is considered vulgar in the refined geisha realm; the layered undergarments, resembling silk bandages, ensure a tubular, demure silhouette.
I am currently over in Estonia, speaking at a conference in Tallinn about media and marketing innovation. The lovely Hando Sinisalu from Best Marketing has been filling me in on the state of affairs over here.  Estonia has been incredibly hard hit by the recession, with an 80% reduction in advertising in print since its peak in 2008. He told me that very few advertisers are spending any money at all - the only category that is seems to be Telecoms, where there is fierce competition.  Between 2000 and 2007, Estonia was one of the fastest growing countries in the region, with year-on-year growth in consumption averaging around 9.5%.  The economy shrank by a massive 14.1% last year, so times are very tough, but the hope of joining the Euro next year is keeping people optimistic.  My presentation was about the learnings we have from the Festival of Media and the Festival of Media Awards, including lots of examples of media innovation, new technologies and branded utility.
For those of you who loved the Valentino Spring 2010 ready-to-wear line   with it\'s organic coral-shaped lace embellishments   when it first appeared on the   However,  on the retail pricing issue, these hit a more negative note.  So, are these retailing for $1000, $2000, or even $3000?  Nay, I say.  These babies will run you a cool $4700   plus shipping.  Ouch.  Are these pretty?  Yes.  Unique?  Certainly.  Are they nearly 5K worth of all that?  Not in this shoeblogger\'s humble opinion.  What do you think?runway last year, you are in luck. Luckily for Jenn, this shoe was tickling my memory.   It is definitely similar to styles that we saw being produced by many designers last spring; blending cage and gladiator sandal styles with a zip-front and high heel.  After a little bit more investigation to jog my memory, these are eerily similar to the (now out of stock)  Christian Louboutin ëZipette\' that was available for sale last spring and the prior fall (2008-2009).  That double platform has been favored by Christian Louboutin for several seasons now. Unfortunately, these are past-season shoes which will make purchasing an original Louboutin style a challenge and test of personal patience (which can pay off, if time is not an issue for you).  On a positive note, there are several designers producing similar, zip-front, caged gladiator sandals for the upcoming spring 2010 season.  The original Louboutin Zipette has long since sold out of luxury retailers such as Saks and Neiman Marcus. So, now it\'s up to Jenn. Does she wants to pursue a Louboutin aftermarket shoe-quest? Or would she prefer a to look at similar, but not identical, offerings that are currently available from several other brands?  I have rounded up several alternatives if she is looking for a style to wear this spring, since a Louboutin quest can take months or years. We hope that his helps Jenn out in her quest for her perfect high-heeled cage gladiator. Last month I had a short telephone call with Courtney and Philip Mason, the owners of a young art-to-wear brand named ëStudio Jellyfish\'.  Call it  a mini-interview, if you wish.  And, despite the writer\'s block that has been for some reason confounding me on this article (this is at least the 3rd draft I have worked on thus far), I am determined to finish this today.  Luckily, the hand-painted artwork of these shoes and handbags is striking enough to speak for itself, so I\'ve decided to start with a few images to ëget the conversation going\'. These painted ladies all have their own personality   and names.   Names like ëGolden Go,\'ess\', ëBlueberry Girl\' and ëBubblegum Girl\'.  You won\'t find any generic style numbers here.  Of course, with every pair carefully embellished by hand, would you expect anything else?    Per Courtney, each ëgirl\' has been designed prior to appearing on a shoe or accessory, and is then free-handed onto the fashion canvas using a paint pen medium. The handmade nature of the creative process makes each pair of shoes subtly unique.  When asked if she had a favorite, Courtney answered without a bit of hesitation, \'Bubblegum Girl, and some new ones that are in the works.\' (Bubblegum Girl is on the second row at the left.)

According to Philip, one of their goals is to bring fine art into everyday accessible fashion. \'all day, every day\'.  And it looks like they have a growing consumer fan base that agrees.  In fact, in the just over 4 months that they have been operating their various websites (online shopfront & etsy.com), they have had orders ranging from the United States to Ireland, London, and Saudi Arabia.  They also have plans in the works to expand into more mainstream fashion which will include denim and shirts and will continue to feature their signature ëgirls\'.  So, who are their favorite designers or other influences?  Ferragamo was immediately mentioned for classic appeal and style. When I mentioned how much their visual style reminded me of the bold simplicity of Patrick Nagel\'s works   but with a hint of Gwen Stefani\'s Harajuku Girls, Philip agreed, saying, \'You pretty much nailed it on the head.\'  He also noted in a separate comment that \'We have twelve years working as graphic designers. We love what we do. We wanted to do something for ourselves and it seemed like a natural transition to move that onto shoes and fashion.\'  Oh, and about the name; why Studio Jellyfish?  (Politely interrupting each other)  \'That goes back to when we first met. We both loved, still love the ocean.  There was this South Beach hotel with a jellyfish tank in the lobby. It reflects our love of the sea and has a lot of our past and memories in it.\'  So, writers block defeated.  Plus, there\'s even a small positive to come from it;  Studio Jellyfish is now holding a spring sale which ends on March 30th.
I can\'t get the stories of Haiti out of my mind.  A patient showed up at the Port au Prince hospital ward with a massive left sided paralysis, an obvious stroke. This 48 year old woman had collapsed the day before and was now accompanied by her three grown daughters, who were most attentive and worried. I examined her in the bed with other patients and families gathered around. (There is no sense of privacy and even an exam seems to be everyone\'s business in Haiti). One daughter spoke broken English but I had a good translator that helped me get the information I needed.  It was a sad story. They had been on the 5th floor when the Earthquake hit. They fell straight down and dad was killed. One of the children had a crush injury to his leg and the entire remaining family was now\'on the street\'. Just surviving must have been such a strain. Then...mom has a massive stroke.  As I was examining the patient further, one daughter handed me a quickly scrawled note. It read.\'I have a problem She have a AIDS\'In this private way, the daughter wanted me to know her mom had AIDS.  In a country with such poverty, lack of health care and lack of education, it is not a surprise that HIV and AIDS remains a significant problem and Haiti is the Caribbean island most affected by AIDS. There also remains a stigma and HIV infection is a big secret. Once I asked my Haitian interpreter to ask an emaciated patient if he was HIV positive and the interpreter couldn\'t even ask the question. It is just not done. It was a real act of bravery for that daughter to pass me the secret note.
Why am I banging on about EGGS all of a su,\'en on a Saturday night (oops...actually it\'s 4am in the morning in Hong Kong here...)?  Well, because I\'ve had a bit of an EGG-citing whirlwind trip to Hong Kong where the first part of the trip was already mind bogglingly EGG-citing but the second part also matched that EGG-citing ness in equal measure.  So that\'s a lot of eggs...  But I promise there is a reason why EGGS are present in the post and hah, it is by no means round about and forced.  Ok maybe it is... oh well, here goes... Joyce aka the store which opened my eyes a little to Hong Kong\'s forward fashion acceptance last time I was there organised an even more eye-opening event to honour a special one-off project that Rodarte has taken part in.  The Mulleavy sisters have created four one-off outfits inspired by four characters played by Maggie Cheung (In the Mood for Love, Hero, The Heroic Trio, Clean) that were on exhibition at a bash thrown last night which accompanied a premiere of a short film directed by Wing Shya (most known for his graphic design and photography work on many Wong Kar Wai films...).  Rodarte.  In Hong Kong.  With Maggie Cheung.  Plenty of Wong Kar Wai connections/connotations.  Whats.NOT.to.like. I\'m getting to the eggs, I promise.  I pretty much landed into Hong Kong feeling like a zombie but had to get stuck right into the proceedings of this event.  First up, a cocktail preceding dinner at renowned dining experience Yin Yang (weirdly enough, I tried to book a meal here last time I was in HK...).  In a group of about 18 peeps... there was Maggie Cheung bounding up to people introducing herself gaily and pretty much exuding friendliness and elegance.  Feeling small doesn\'t even quite cut it.  It is one of those cliches that everyone of Chinese origin (or maybe even non-Chinese origins...) universally hearts Maggie Cheung and she has \'national treasure\' written all over (Judi Dench, you doth protest too much about the term...!) and frankly I\'m not going to exempt myself.  She IS someone both my grandmother, my mother and me can get down with and after meeting her and err....  not creepily watching her at dinner... no, not at all.... I can go back home with happy reports.  The my mother will yelp with jealousy.
Good news for U.S. territories; Del. Donna M. Christensen (D-Virgin Islands) announced Thursday  she and fellow territorial delegates were successful in including the territories in the health care reform bill released by the House leadership.   \'After numerous meetings over the past two weeks with members and senior staff and with the leadership in the House, Senate and with President Obama, the territories are in the bill,\' Christensen said.  While Christensen is pleased with the current proposal she said the bill was not perfect but will play a \'significant role in improving the health care of the American men, women and children living in the U.S. territories.\'  \'Not only will the U.S. Virgin Islands receive an enormous infusion of new Medicaid dollars, but we also have access to the health insurance exchange.\'   Christensen released a statement thanking, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Chairman Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.),  House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), and her colleagues in the Congressional Tri-Caucus, which includes Latino and Asia members of Congress.   \'This whole process confirms that when ordinary people come together around common ground, extraordinary things can happen, Christensen declared.
I keep wanting to use the word webinar, but I can\'t decide if it is too jargony. This  lexical conundrum reminds me of when the word workout went mainstream. It sounded too jargony  to me, and I used to say go-to-the-gym and a not-so-snappy stand-in.  Should I use the word webinar?  Should I tell you how many times Ryan Paugh told me that I have to announce the webinar if I want people to come to it? I kept not announcing anything because I didn\'t know what to call it.  Whatever we are calling it, it will happen on this Friday, 1pm est. (Sign up here.) I know that people in Australia cannot listen at this time slot. You have told me before, and I\'m listening. One day I will do a webinar at midnight. One day I will record webinars so it won\'t matter so much what time slot they happen in. One day there will be world peace.  On Friday we will talk about finding fulfillment, which is actually like establishing world peace, just doing it one person at a time. In an act of full disclosure, I\'m going to tell you that knowing what to do is not the hard part of finding fulfillment. Doing it is the hard part. It\'s like breaking up with a terrible boyfriend when the sex is really good. Not that I have ever had this problem. I have found that part of what makes a terrible boyfriend is terrible sex. But whatever. I can imagine the problem. The problem is that you  know what to do and you don\'t do it.  Wait. Actually, that\'s the problem with everything. Like, I knew I was going to have to write a post about the webinar where I don\'t know if I should use the word webinar. I knew it wasn\'t going to change if I waited so long to write the post that Ryan Paugh wants to kill me. But I waited anyway. Why do we not take the action that we know is the right action? I will not be covering this problem in the webinar.
An 11-year-old girl -- a precocious reader -- was visiting my home a few weekends ago. Over the past year, she\'d devoured\'The Great Gatsby,\'The Joy Luck Club\'and\'Huckleberry Finn.\'She noticed the review copy of Picoult\'s 17th novel,\'House Rules,\'on my coffee table and said that she\'d liked some of Picoult\'s other works, especially\'My Sister\'s Keeper\'and\'The Tenth Circle.\'I told her this new novel was wonderful.  Big mistake.  Shyly, she asked if she could borrow it. I\'m an educator, someone who, by training and disposition, is inclined to applaud a young person\'s thirst for reading. But I grabbed that fat review copy out of the kid\'s paws so fast she didn\'t have time to blink. The possessive hoarder who wants to keep all good books within reach had been awakened. I muttered something inane about the reviewers\' code of honor forbi,\'ing me to lend books before they\'ve been published. Hey, if this 11-year-old wunderkind has absorbed anything from her reading, she\'s surely learned the fundamental lesson of every Jodi Picoult fictional family: Life\'s tough.  Throughout the long unfolding of\'House Rules,\'Picoult keeps so many storyline streamers whirling in the air that it would be easy just to praise her technical mastery. But though the multiple plots and narrators are, indeed, adroitly managed, what most readers will cherish is the character of Jacob Hunt, an 18-year-old high school student with Asperger\'s syndrome. (Jacob, in goofy teen fashion, jokes:\'Asperger\'s. I mean, doesn\'t it sound like a Grade Z cut of meat? Donkey on the barbecue?\')  Asperger\'s rules Jacob\'s life and the life of his family, which consists of his understandably resentful-but-guilty younger brother, Theo, and his wry and exhausted mom, Emma. (Although Dad sends child support, he fled the coop long ago.) Emma ensures that a sense of routine -- so crucial to Jacob\'s emotional well-being -- is strictly maintained from week to week. His clothes are color-coded in his closet; daily meals are color-coded too (Monday food is green; Tuesday, red; Wednesday, yellow), and his diet is restricted, since glutens and caseins spark meltdowns. As Emma observes:\'Frankly, with 1 in 100 kids in the United States being diagnosed on the [autism] spectrum, I bet I could have a top-rated show on the Food Network: Alimentary Autism. Jacob doesn\'t share my culinary enthusiasm. He says that I\'m what you\'d get if you crossed Jenny Craig with Josef Mengele.
On Wednesday night, I was honored to be a guest on CUNY TV\'s Brian Lehrer Live, a weekly current events show filmed here in New York. I was there, along with Marisa Meltzer, the author of Girl Power: the Nineties Revolution in Music and Rob Walker, who writes the NYT\'s\'Consumed\'column and is also the author of Buying In: What We Buy and Who We Are. I was there to talk about the YouTube phenomenon that is the haul video. If you\'ve never seen a haul video, it\'s basically a person doing on camera what you usually do when you come back from a shopping trip: excitedly show what you\'ve bought to anyone who\'ll listen. Except in a haul video, you show it in front of your webcam and then post it on YouTube for an audience of thousands. Most haul videos are made by teenage girls, and most of the items been shown off are clothing or makeup, though a thorough browsing of the genre reveals that there are haul videos about a whole range of products, including groceries. It was a really interesting discussion, one that touched on issues of consumerism, teenage belonging and self-identity and on the cultural emphasis placed on women\'s beauty and the products we\'re encouraged to buy to achieve it. As you can imagine, I\'ve been thinking a lot about haul videos in the last few days, and I think there are a few noteworthy things going on here. First, I think it\'s important to note that these videos are predominately made by teenage girls, and that the vast majority of the money they\'re spending is on clothes and on makeup. As I mentioned in the segment, the average American woman will spend over $20,000 on cosmetic products alone between the ages of 13 and 29. And that doesn\'t include manicures, pedicures, haircuts or colorings - that\'s just for makeup products.  Once you a,\' in those services and include other services like tanning and waxing, the number goes up over $40,000. Over the course of a lifetime, the average American woman will spend about $500,000 on making herself beautiful. Half a million dollars. That\'s a studio apartment in New York. It\'s two full rides to medical school. And while a lot of women never go tanning or get a pedicure, and while products and services obviously cost less depending on where you live, as well as a number of other factors, that\'s still an enormous percentage of women\'s collective earnings being spent on making ourselves beautiful. As I said on Wednesday night, I\'m in no position to tell anyone how to spend their money, but I think it\'s important to take a moment and imagine all the other things we could do with that money, and to carefully examine the reasons why we spend it on making ourselves beautiful. I should clarify that I don\'t think these women are buying these products because I think they\'re vain or vapid.
Eco fashion has been a profoundly online phenomenon from the get-go.  Slowly but surely, however, boutiques are cropping up all over North America and Europe.  If you\'re in Vancouver, you don\'t want to miss the chance to check out Body Politic founded by Nicole Ritchie-Oseen in 2008 and located in the South Main district of the city.  Body Politic features some of the hottest green designers including Stewart + Brown, Elroy and Perfectly Imperfect.  Ritchie-Oseen says, \'At body politic we began with the belief that sustainable and eco-friendly clothing didn\'t mean sacrificing style. The goal was to fuel our absolute love of fashion and distinct style without compromising our environment, our community, or ourselves!\'  The space is as green as the fashion, with energy efficient lighting, re-purposed furniture and raw concrete walls as a neutral palette against which the carefully selected clothing and accessories stand out beautifully.  Can\'t make it to Vancouver?  No worries!  Body Politic also sells online at www.bodypolitic.ca.  You can also keep up with the official Body Politic Blog, follow them on Facebook, and on Twitter.  Supporting eco fashion designers and retailers is one of the best ways we can put our money where our ethics is.  Drop by in person or online and give Body Politic a looksee  The earthquake that shook Haiti happened weeks ago, but the needs of the Haitians are greater now than ever.  Doctors, supplies, and provisions must continue to be sent to assist families that are still suffering from the effects of losing everything including loved ones.  To answer the call, the independently owned jewelry company Love Heals has created four special pieces of which they will donate 100% of the profits to Doctors Without Borders.

Hi. I am Kim Moldofsky from Morton Grove, Illinois. Agliophobia is a fear of pain; iatrophobia is a fear of doctors, but I have yet to find a word that defines my biggest fearóa fear of pre-existing conditions. My fear of pre-existing conditions began years ago when I was diagnosed with Sjogren\'s Syndrome, an auto-immune disease that causes dry eye and dry mouth. My illness seemed more of nuisance than a health crisis, so I was shocked when after my husband\'s employer went bankrupt and we lost our medical coverage, I was repeatedly told that I was uninsurable due to this condition. That was back in 2001, when I was 33 years old.  Eventually, my husband found a job with benefits. After a period of time, my faulty immune system was covered in full, which was helpful because by then I had developed rheumatoid arthritis. Still, once it was diagnosed, and I found the right combination of medicines to combat my symptoms, life continued at a normal pace. We were happy to have medical insurance, but we didn\'t have a great policy. We had a $5,000 deductible for our family, and with two young children under foot, we often met that deductible. At one point, I realized our high cost, high deductible actually penalized us for using the plan. For example, using the mail-order pharmacy aligned with our plan, it cost me over $2,000 a year for certain medication, a certain arthritis drug. On my doctor\'s recommendation, I checked the prices at the local Costco. It turned out that the same drug cost me less than $300 without my insurance at Costco.  In the fall of 2008, my husband lost his job and eventually his benefits. This time, I felt fortunate to find a private insurance, a private insurer saving me the expense of the state plan. However, like many policies, it does not provide coverage on the issues that matter most to my family, even my 9-year-old son has a pre-existing condition that is not covered. And of course, my arthritis, well they accepted me into a plan, into the plan with a special deductible for arthritis-related treatment. Knowing that this typically only involves a couple thousand dollars of treatment a year, we felt okay with that. However, it wasn\'t until after we had signed on the dotted line, the only dotted line that was available to cover my entire family, that we learned this deductible which I assumed was $5,000 or $10,000 was actually a $65,000 deductibleóa $65,000 deductible for the most pressing medical condition in my family.  It is not creaking bones that keep me awake at nightóit\'s the fear of developing a condition related to my arthritis that could send us tumbling into bankruptcy. Although I have some coverage, I have a fear of unexpected news, o,\' test results, a new diagnosis. I have a fear of a new pre-existing condition, a phobia without a name. Although we pay several hundred dollars a month for access to quality care, I am afraid to use it. I often ignore minor aches and pains. I have held off on some scheduled blood tests and exam, and I worry that my attempt to save a few dollars now could cost me dearly in the future if minor problems spiral into larger ones, but ironically, as long as people with pre-existing conditions can be denied coverage, spending money on doctor visits and tests to solve problems early on could actually cost more dearly in the future.
So a few weeks(?) ago I got a message from some guy on OkCupid. He seemed smart, funny, cute and familiar. Like we\'d met already. I couldn\'t place him, though.  So I replied to his message and said, straight out, You seem familiar, is it possible that we\'ve met?  A couple of days passed and I didn\'t hear back from him, so I figured he placed me from somewhere (maybe we went out years ago, or something) and didn\'t want to reply.  In the meantime, I was getting some unwanted attention from a bunch of guys (young, persistent ones who clearly had been hearing wild things about older women) and so I decided to shut down the OkCupid profile and focus on Match and Chemistry.  So then a week or so later I got a message from that same guy on Match.com, asking me where I went to/why I disappeared? I thought it was sweet the way he followed up with me on another site. But he didn\'t mention my question about looking familiar.  You know where this is going, don\'t you?  I think I\'ve figured it out.  After a few messages back and forth, he said something in a message that jogged my memory.  I think he\'s this guy.  I\'m 95% sure (but not 100%).  It\'s embarrassing that I don\'t recognize him from his pictures or profile and that he doesn\'t recognize me (my profile is almost identical, and while my pictures are new they really do look like me).  But I have to admit, my memory is completely useless lately (I take some medicine that messes it up, and so I write EVERYTHING down).  And I\'ve always been bad at recognizing people/faces.  So now what? He\'s been aggressively pursuing me, online, for weeks. Do I just stop replying?  Do I tell him that I think we already went out last summer and tell him the details and see if it was him?  Do I just let it ride and go out with him, again, telling him nothing about my suspicions just to see what happens?  Could this possibly be the universe telling me that that bad date was a fluke and me and this guy should meet again?  Today\'s girl has really evolved in the last couple of years. I honestly didn\'t recognize her when I was going through the thumbnails!  Yesterday\'s answer is behind the cut. Were you correct?
It\'s funny, but I barely remember the first time I visited New York. I was nine years old, and went with my Dad and brother to see the World\'s Fair in Queens. I remember the It\'s a Small World Exhibit, but mostly I remember the car ride home on the Jersey Turnpike, gazing out at the brightly lit New York skyline and realizing for the first time that if it\'s dark outside, you can actually look sideways out the window and not get car sick.    The next time I visited New York, I was on an eight grade class trip. I think we went to the United Nations, but I don\'t recall that. Here are the two things I do remember - (1) singing\'99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall\'while stuck in traffic coming out of the Lincoln Tunnel onto 42nd Street, which in those days was lined with Peep Shows and Porn Shops and (2) being a smart-ass with my friends and leaving a one-cent tip at the restaurant in Tudor City where we were packed in and served overcooked Salisbury Steak, which was basically inedible. (Even then, I was a food critic..)  The third time I visited New York, I fell in love. It was a day trip I took during college with my best friends. I think we must have seen a play, but for the life of me, I don\'t remember what it was. This time it was lunch at Mama Leone\'s, which even I, the rube from Philly, recognized as cattle call for tourists - the place was loud and packed and I felt like a number.  And the portions?  HUGE. Like\'I think I\'m gonna\' be sick\', huge.  So we decided to walk it off with a stroll in Central Park. And it was there, sitting under the Wisteria Arbor on the West Drive, that I fell. Hard.   Maybe it was  the intoxicating floral perfume. Combined with post-prandial carbohydrate overload and a bit of a buzz from the wine we had with lunch. And a warm spring day and best friends. And that skyline. (Clearly, it was not the food...) All I knew was - I was in love. With a city. And I knew - I had to move here.
Acne is the word every teen hates but faces this nightmare at one point or the other during her growing years. There are as many numbers of creams and lotions available as the number of teens with acne! New research suggests that a diet with foods containing low glycemic loads could help people suffering from acne to get rid of their acne.  Scientists from th RMIT university in Melbourne studied the effect of food on about forty three patients aged between 15 and 25 years. They were randomly assigned a normal diet and a low glycemic load diet for 12 weeks. The diet consisted of 25 percent energy from protein and 45 percent from low-glycemic-index carbohydrates.  It was found that people whose diet consisted of low-glycemic-index carbohydrates had a significant reduction in the total acne when compared to people on a normal diet.  What is Glycemic index?  The Glycemic Index (GI) relates to the way your body\'s sugar levels respond to certain foods. Foods are given a rating from 0 -100 on the glycemic index with glucose in the highest position. High Glycemic Index foods (such as simple carbohydrates) will increase the body\'s sugar levels rapidly whereas low glycemic index foods will increase the body\'s sugar levels slowly according to HWF.  The new findings suggest that diets that contain low glycemic loads may not only improve insulin sensitivity and helps reduce weight but clears up acne as well.  So, if you want to get rid of acne and have a blemish free skin, foods that have high glycemic index like white bread, sugar, potatoes are a strict NO. However you can eat low-glycemic foods like whole grains, vegetables, fish and lean meat as these foods are kinder to your skin and say good bye to acne forever
Marisa Meltzer is the author of Girl Power: The Nineties Revolution in Music and the co-author of How Sassy Changed My Life: A Love Letter to the Greatest Teen Magazine of All Time. She is a contributor at Slate and the Daily Beast, where she reviews books and movies, and writes about gender in popular culture.  Girl Power, which Courtney posted about a few months ago, is about the evolution of the feminist message in music during the era when Meltzer was coming of age. In the process of writing her book, Meltzer, who was a fan of Kathleen Hanna and Sleater-Kinney as a teen, travelled around the country attending music festivals, revisited the records of her youth, and even got a chance to meet and interview some of the women who made those records. But she also confesses that in order to write Girl Power, she had to watch the Spice Girls movie. Meltzer seems to have pretty much the coolest job in the world - Spice Girls movie aside.  Feministing readers who love music, movies and Sarah Haskins should check out Meltzer\'s archive of writing for the Daily Beast. Feministing readers who secretly love the Bring It On franchise should wait until no one\'s around to see their browser tabs and then go read Meltzer\'s analysis of the series.  And now, without further ado, the Feministing Five, with Marisa Meltzer.
Public=Online is the the rallying cry during this year\'s Sunshine Week, an annual event to highlight the importance of open government and the freedom of information. The week is sponsored by the American Society of News Editors, and many editorial boards have echoed the thoughts of the Cleveland Plain Dealer:      \'...government information ought to be made available to the public as quickly as possible, with a minimum of rigmarole and in the easiest, most accessible way possible--which these days means via the Internet.\'  We agree--and what better way to celebrate Sunshine Week than with leading thinkers on government, media and citizen engagement on all sides of the political spectrum who feel the same? Yesterday at our Google D.C. office, the Sunlight Foundation announced its Public=Online campaign.  It\'s exciting to see growing support for transparency and to see the progress that\'s been made in the last year alone. Every day, through sites like Data.gov and projects like Open Congress, OMB Watch and our Public Data Explorer, more data is available online.  But there\'s still a gap between having access to government data and easily understanding what it means. To help fill this gap, Google has partnered with the Sunlight Foundation in its Design for America contest to make government data more comprehensible to the public. You can learn more and get started on the contest homepage. There\'s room for all kinds of folks to participate, and we can\'t think of a more fun way to keep the spirit of Sunshine Week going.
Students excavate a kiln at Cheung Ek, Cambodia. Photo courtesy of Phon Kaseka Cheung Ek is infamous for being the site of a Khmer Rouge killing fieldósome 20,000 Cambodians were murdered here between 1975 and 1979. Yet Cheung Ek also has a much older history, and today a team of archaeologists led by Phon Kaseka of the Royal Academy of Cambodia is investigating what lies beneath this once horrifying landscape. The team has found that Cheung Ek was settled around 300 B.C. and played an important part in the emergence of Southeast Asia\'s first great economy, the mysterious Indian-influenced civilization known as Funan. Centered in the lower Mekong floodplain, Funan flourished from about the first to the sixth century and eventually gave rise to the well-known kingdom of Angkor, which culminated in the 13th century. According to Kyle Latinis of the University of Cambodia, \'Cheung Ek may be one of the pinnacles\' in a complex of sites. Both Roman and Chinese historical texts record trade voyages to Funan, and archaeologists have uncovered artifacts from Rome, Persia, India, and Greece at the Funan port town of Oc Eo, now located in southern Vietnam. Archaeologists also have investigated another important Funan site, Angkor Borei, in southern Cambodia. Kaseka\'s team is just beginning to investigate Cheung Ek, but it has already discovered 61 pottery kilns strung out over a distance of three miles (five kilometers). The kilns have been carbon-dated to between the fifth and seventh centuries, making them the oldest uncovered so far in this part of Southeast Asia. If the kilns were all used around the same time, that would support the idea that Cheung Ek was a major pottery produceróand therefore critical to Funan\'s economy. Local potters likely made several kinds of pots, including spouted vessels called kendi, which were used for storing and pouring water, perhaps in ritual ceremonies. Archaeologists can learn a remarkable amount about ancient technology and trade from studying kilns and the waste that can be recovered from them, such as clay debris and pots broken during manufacture. By examining the chemical composition of the clay debris and then testing kendi pots from the same time period that have been recovered at sites across Southeast Asia, the team hopes to determine the extent of Cheung Ek\'s trade network. Like many other Funan-period sites, Cheung Ek may have continued to be occupied after the decline of Funan and well into the era of Angkor. A mysterious large, almost perfectly circular earthwork dates from at least the tenth century, and the team is testing several hypotheses as to its design and purpose. Work has yielded stone inscriptions, architecture, brick temple or shrine foundations, and other features characteristic of later periods. Kaseka\'s team is eager to continue excavating the site\'s kilns, temples, and houses, but it faces difficulties.  Cambodia is recovering from its violent past under Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, but the recovery process is proving detrimental to the nation\'s cultural heritage. Growth has been rapid and often uncontrolled, and the external demand for marketable artifacts has intensified. Urbanization and looting are destroying Cheung Ek\'s history. \'Action needs to be taken now,\' says Kaseka. As part of a new generation of Cambodian scholars, Kaseka wants any fieldwork plans to include community education, and he wants to find ways to persuade developers and looters not to destroy the site or any others like it. Sections of Cheung Ek have been preserved as a site museum, a memorial to the horrors of the killing fields. Now efforts are being made to preserve the parts of this site that could reveal so much about Cambodia\'s distant past.
New rules took effect February in Delaware governing the arbitration of business disputes in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The rules implement amendments to Delaware law, adopted last year, granting the Chancery Court jurisdiction to arbitrate certain business disputes, and compliment rules already in place governing the Court\'s mediation of business and technology disputes.  Under the new law, the Court of Chancery has jurisdiction to arbitrate \'business disputes,\' which would include most complex corporate and commercial disputes. At least one of the parties must be a business entity, and at least one must be organized under Delaware law or have its principal place of business in Delaware. No party can be a consumer. In a claim exclusively for monetary damages, the amount in controversy must be at least $1 million. All parties must consent to the arbitration.  Arbitration in the Court of Chancery can have numerous advantages over litigation or other forms of arbitration, in that it provides prompt and confidential resolution by an experienced and sophisticated arbitrator. The arbitration will be heard by either a judge or master sitting permanently in the Court of Chancery. The petition and all subsequent arbitration proceedings are confidential, and are not included in the Court\'s pubic docketing system (unless there is an appeal). A preliminary conference will be held within 10 days of the filing of a petition, with a final hearing taking place within 90 days of the filing.  Selection of arbitration in the Delaware Chancery Court may be appropriate for many complex commercial ventures and arrangements among U.S. entities, as well as those involving non-U.S. entities, often presenting the most straightforward, predictable and efficient form of dispute resolution, including for buy-sell arrangements, purchase price adjustments, governance disputes in joint ventures, and a wide variety of similar situations. Litigation, in Delaware and elsewhere, will continue to be a feature of disputes involving public company merger and acquisition transactions and governance matters, and planning for stockholder litigation in particular is a crucial part of transactional and governance preparedness. But serious thought should be given to selecting arbitration in the Delaware Chancery Court as a dispute resolution mechanism for other forms of corporate and commercial disputes, both in transactions and more generally.
Its not particularly hard to lose a messaging war against Republicans. I mean, you aren\'t working against the kind of sophisticated public relations machine typically reserved for say, a Kardashian. You\'re not even handling a hot potato. If it weren\'t for the lucky strike of stumbling into a minority by nominating a candidate who, up close, appeared to be melting, Republicans wouldn\'t even be able to consider their drumbeat of\'NO!\'much of a message at all. Putting aside the deep irony - Nancy Pelosi and Henry Waxman both filed amicus briefs when Ralph Nader challenged the Constitutionality of the so-called\'Slaughter Rule\'- Democratic leaders immediately fell prey to the only response\'deem\'-ing a bill passed can possibly elicit.  No. Seriously. WTF (followed, as usual, by\'Tea Party,\'but that\'s another story for another day).  Don\'t get me wrong. I\'d be happy to adopt a\'deem\'and\'pass\'approach to almost anything. Louboutains too expensive? I deem them passed into my closet. Parking too tough? I deem and pass my double parking into legitimacy. Deeming and passing a flurry of ideas would not only ensure that the world bows to my dominion, but would, frankly, make Congress more effective. But call me skeptical that an $800+ billion spending bill should be deemed to have passed just like that. Beyond feeling powerless in the whole matter, I feel like I should have the right to know if my Congressman decided, for example, to have his vote purchased with earmark spending or a lobbyist-sponsored\'fact-finding\'trip to the Caymans.  Not to mention, the current bill happens to be unpopular. Which presents a problem. The real solution would be to go back to the drawing board and draft a bill we can all live with, but that involves work - which people get themselves elected to Congress to avoid - and if they spend more than one more week a,\'ressing health care as opposed to, say, dramatic job losses, Congress will see its approval rating sink even lower...perhaps to the level of their Kardashian rivals.  So faced with a decision - significant work or pass an unpopular bill through a back door method that people don\'t quite understand - Democrats chose the latter.
If I\'m being completely honest, I\'d have to say that my quest to cut down on my multitasking has really been in vain. I really just don\'t think it\'s in my nature to only do one thing at a time. I try, but I get bored or I feel guilty that I should be doing more. My a,\'iction to technology doesn\'t help either and neither does that the fact that I\'m a workaholic. I mix work with play all the time & play with work. Not to mention trying to fit in family friends in between errands and new projects I start.  I came upon this whole goal of reducing multitasking thinking it might cut down on my stress, but I think it\'s making me more stressed thinking about all the shit I have to do! A,\'ed to the stress factor, I also heard a few reports on NPR about how multitasking can make your brain less effective, but so does a glass of wine and I\'m not giving that up!  Oh, why can\'t I be happy doing less?  I have these notions of mediating and being more in the moment, but both of those things just seem to yet another thing to a,\' to my to-do list.  What about you? Am I along in this quest or are you all struggling with the idea of trying to lead a simpler less harried life only to be thwarted by yourself? I am on the search for a virtual intern for Summer 2010.  Responsibilities will include:     1. Conducting research for stories.    2. Help me coordinate a variety of projectsówhich will mostly involve contacting artists, scheduling & organizing details.    3. Respond to email!    4. Writing assignments both assigned and those based on your own interests.    5. Other stuff that comes up.  Workload will be about 8-10 hours a week and there is absolutely no pay, but the glory, oh the glory   If you are interested, email me at jen@indiefixx.com with a brief note about why you are interested in being my intern and a resume as well. Please feel free to pass this on to anyone who may be interested.  For a student, I\'d be happy to write a letter of recommendation after a successful internship. I\'d also be happy to promote projects that the intern may be working on personally.  I will collect resumes until May 15th and get back to those who I\'d like to interview after that. Please note that this is a virtual internship, so your location does not matter, but you must be super self-motivated.
Nobody knows DIY beauty better than Kayla Fioravanti, Co-founder and Chief Cosmetic Formulator for Essential Wholesale. So if the Visa bill was bigger than you expected or you\'ve just been keeping a keener eye on your pennies, then these tips are just up your alley!  Winter Beauty Tips: Potatoes have so many uses!  Slice raw potatoes and put them on your eye lids to reduce puffiness.  Or cure swollen feet with a mashed potato foot soak!  Just purchase a box of dehydrated mashed potatoes and followed the recipe. Once you have your mashed potatoes a,\' lukewarm or cool water to get the temperature to the right level to soak your feet.  The potatoes will retain heat longer than a traditional foot bath and they help reduce swelling and soften skin.  To make it special a,\' essential oils before you put your feet in. Then indulge feet into one of the best soaks you\'ll ever experience!   (It\'s perfect for making use of those leftovers )  This same concept can be used with Oatmeal.  Oatmeal will be soothing and deeply restorative to dry cracked and painful feet.   Exfoliate:  In the winter, the most important thing to do to keep skin remaining healthy is to exfoliate twice per week to remove dead skin cells.  Central heating plays havoc on the sebum our skin normally produces, which makes our skin lose water which should be retained in the lower dermis of the skin.  During the winter months there are thousands of dry skin cells ready to be sloughed off the surface and they become clumped together with oil which forms what appear to be flakes. Don\'t be flaky, exfoliate! Exfoliate your facial skin with crËme based exfoliates with jojoba beads.  You can exfoliate your body with a butter, oil, or crËme scrub that uses salts or sugars.   Hydrotherapy:  For a simple in home hydrotherapy, start out your day with a hot steamy shower and just as you are finishing switch the water to cold for about fifteen seconds. Repeat the process for two minutes. This hydrotherapy technique will revitalize your skin by stimulating the flow of blood through the skin.
For the millions of people in Japan who spend too much time at work to have pets, a social life, or a partner, help is at hand.  It started with Tokyo\'s cat cafÈs, where customers can sit around and sip coffeeóand also rent a cat, for 10 bucks an hour. With Japan\'s economy in deep recession, cu,\'les are clearly in demand; customers ranging from schoolgirls to engineers are flocking to businesses such as Neko no Mise (\'Cat Store\'). Clients receive a\'menu\'of the felines available for petting; balls of wool and plastic mice are complimentary.  The cat cafÈs have become so popular that more than 150 businesses have sprung up to offer animals for hireóferrets, turtles, squirrels, monkeys--on an hourly, weekly, or even monthly basis, if you want to bring the critter home. Dogs are predictably popular, but for those with a smaller apartment and budget, beetles are an option.  One agency has taken the idea of renting whatever makes your life complete a step further. Hagemashi Tai (\'I Want to Cheer Up Limited\') rents out relatives. Whether it\'s for a we,\'ing or funeral, you can choose the perfect person to accompany you, rather than go solo. The agency also offers a service to single mothers seeking a male role model for their children. The\'father\'will attend school events, take the kid to the park, help with homework. Kikue Shimizu, 37, has a weekly arrangement with just such a rent-a-dad.\'My two boys are growing up without a father figure in their lives,\'she says.\'I need someone who can talk to them about their education, their futures.\'To be sure, the tradition of paying someone to be nice to you has a long history in Japan, dating back to the dawn of the geisha. Consequently, there\'s no stigma attached to the fact that the so-called cousin at your side is clocking up the yen by the hour.
It\'s always such an encouragement to see other families dealing with SID. My son (6yrs) was diagnosed with SID with speech/language delay when he was 2. We\'ve been in heavy (and expensive) therapy since then. Before kindergarden, when we were seeing very little improvement from the OT, he was also diagnosed with ADHD. As what I felt was a last resort, we chose to try medication (a patch Daytrana that administers meds only when on). I was so concerned about how he would be able to function in a classroom setting. For you doctors and researchers out there, I think this is worth noting: My son\'s speech was pretty bad. Low understanding of language, and an often flipping of phrases almost as if every sentence was a word scramble with conjunctions rarely used. Within 3 hours of administering his first patch, my son began talking at lightning speed, AND FULLY CORRECT! It was as if a knotted ball of string that once was his words and thoughts had been pulled straight. IT WAS AMAZING ! And he seemed to know that he was speaking correctly. He talked for about 8 hours straight. For the first time, words were coming out the way he meant them. The medication hasn\'t been a cure-all, but it has enabled him to focus on his work and sit still at school, follow complex instructions from parents and teachers, and helped him with social interaction. I know that\'s not what some of you want to hear, but I think research needs to be done on how ADHD meds can benefit SID kids.
Thank you for all who voted in the poll. Eighty-one percent of you believe I should put ads on the blog. I\'m going to wait and see. Reasons are: 1) Ads don\'t jive with the purpose of the blog I\'ve started this\'guerilla\'undercover lunch project... and then you guys, my readers, get some weird off-beat Goo*gle ads, which most likely will have nothing to do with what I\'m doing here. 2) Donations and transparency I love the idea of making a donation to a farm-to-school initiative and I may just do that on my own time. But if I set up ads, how do I do that? with my real name? and SSN#? And then I\'m assuming I get the ad check directly, which then I have to deposit and then turn around and donate. Basically, I can\'t make it go from blog to organization unless I put a donate button. I haven\'t done enough research into specific organizations and I don\'t want it to look like I\'m endorsing some over others. So now is not the right time. 3) Lack of time I don\'t have very much time what with working, family life, and running our home. If running ads even a,\'s just 10 minutes per day of extra work, I honestly don\'t have that time. I\'m already going to bed way later than usual because of the project. I just can\'t do any more than I\'m already doing. I can barely find time to read all of your excellent comments! *** I was thinking that if I decide to go with ads, I could donate the ad revenue to my school when/if I get found out. I think I\'m going to get\'busted\'one day and I\'m unsure of what ramifications there would be. But if I could off-set the bad press with a little ad revenue for my school, that could be a nice way to smooth things over.
I am a flight att. and waitress and single mom. I work like a dog.I had been hurting for months and then began swelling and having red joints. In April I was diagnosed with RA and the doctor prescribed Humira. I had been taking Voltaren which mad no difference. Anyway, I was worried about the side effect of a lowered immune system. So far, no colds, but I cut my hands at work(paper cuts) and they become angry and swollen, not healing at all. I also experienced complete numbness in both arms and hands the night after my second injection. Has anyone else taken Humira? How is your immunity? My joints and pain are so much better. Only 2 fingers still swollen and red. I have to be able to stand 13-14 hrs about 6 days a week. Please let me know about Humira .Thanks.
It sounds like that is what you have. I have achalasia. I am 26. I had surgery on the 6th of this month. You need to bring up achalasia to your doctors. It is a progressive disease---so yes, unfortunately it has gotten worse with age. They might suggest botox injections since you are a little older than myself but they might also suggest surgery---mine was done through my stomach----opposed to open surgery---I am still recovering but I believe that I will be fine---the only thing is that if you do the surgery do not do the botox treatments---it can cause scar tissue making the surgery more risky than it already is. I had one botox treatment a year ago to alleviate some of the symptoms---but the scar tissue was there and things could have gone very badly. Please heed my advice and call your doctor!
I was planning today to write about how Ricki hasn\'t stolen borekas for a whole week or so. Progress. (GRIN) Real progress. Don\'t worry- she didn\'t. But imagine my happy balloon deflating as I saw Ricki extracting my VERY EXPENSIVE camera from her school bag this afternoon. In the morning I had caught a shot of her frying an egg (I\'ll post it tomorrowhopefully), although by the time I had fetched the camera, the shot was not as good as what I had wanted to photograph. Then I must have left it in sight, and Ricki simply gave herself permission to make off with it, and took some 50 pictures at school today. I am only happy that the camera came back in one piece .and that she isn\'t (hopefully) stealing borekas.
Got an email yesterday from a friend, with a link to an article about recent changes over at Google. Seems the search giant has yet again tweaked its search functionality. Such news always alarms me, as I teach Internet search and this usually means extra work. This time, though, the change is a small one. According to CBC News, Google is combining its multiple search offerings (web, images, blogs, etc.) into a single\'universal search\'. The change is only evident at Google.com (not the various international flavours of Google) and pretty superficial, from the user\'s perspective anyway. A few sample images and news search results ó if there are any ó have been rolled into the web search results list. Google also now offers the ability to narrow by related search. The various search types (which were displayed immediately above the search field) are now at the top left of your screen. A,\'itional search types are available through a dropdown instead of a link to a separate page and they are reduced in number. Compare for yourself. Here\'s Google.com and here\'s the Canadian variant. I can\'t quite see the point of this. But oh well. It\'s not earth-shattering.
I\'d just like to say that I\'ve really enjoyed reading the comments. Thank you. I love reading your personal stories about school lunches. I also see a lot of opinions about the photos and about food options in your children\'s schools. And every commenter who tells me to keep going is also appreciated. The best part of the comments is that we are opening a dialogue about school lunches in our country. *** And I\'ve done another email interview. This time with mother nature network : An interview with school lunch blogger Mrs. Q Thanks Robin! *** I think when we look at under-performing schools and we want to change those numbers, we need to question everything. Teachers\' skills, abilities, and training are often a,\'ressed in the media as a big part of the picture. You know, I attend quality professional development activities through my district every 1-2 months depending on the schedule. That\'s pretty darn good if you ask me. I always learn something new. But nowhere have I ever seen anyone think about what we offer children for lunch. Let\'s think about what we give students to ingest. For instance, I personally enjoy eating hot dogs maybe every 4-6 months, mostly in the summer cooked on a grill. Also I eat them when I go to the ballpark as a special treat. But I wonder if we should give a child a hot dog lunch and then ask them to take the ISAT (state test)... *** In 2004 Jamie Oliver launched an effort to improve school lunches in the UK. He started a program called School Dinners and he wrote a manifesto about what he wanted to see happen in the school lunch movement (I love the word\'manifesto\'). Not all schools accepted his new program, but many did. In 2006-7, the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at Essex University comes along and decides to study 11-year-old kids who ate the new diet of fresh food for at least 12 months. Results: An independent study shows the performance of 11-year-old pupils eating Oliver\'s meals improved by up to 8% in science and as much as 6% in English, while absenteeism due to ill-health fell by 15%. The researchers controlled for other variables and compared the results to the schools where the kids did not have access to the fresh food. WOW. That\'s all I can say.
I\'ve been inundated with emails and notes from various Alzheimer\'s charities and groups about their promotions leading up to World Alzheimer\'s Day on September 21. We\'re right around the 2 year anniversary of when my dad was violently taken from the house after trying to kill my mom, and thus he started on the horrible spiral that led to his death 2 months later. I can\'t bear to read it again, maybe I never will, but if you are interested it starts here. I can\'t imagine when I will ever be able to look back at the months of September, October and November 2007 without pain. Some days I can\'t even bear to think about my father. It\'s usually when I am alone, driving, when it hits me--a song on the radio, passing a store or restaurant he liked, or even a random chain of thoughts that leads me to think my dad was stolen from me and no matter what drugs they come up with now, I can never ever get him back. Then I drive the long way home, until I finish crying. Which is my excuse, I guess, for neglecting this blog. I think about writing, but it stirs everything up, and then I end up in front of my computer crying into my cat\'s fur. Here are some of the campaigns that have been brought to my attention lately. If I missed yours, let me know!
Today the kids and I had lunch at my inlaws house. Sebastian was in a bad mood and kept grunting at anyone who disturbed him while he was eating. In an attempt to get Sebasatian to verbalise his discontent we were encouraging him to say\'go away\'. Sebastian mimicked the words with litle enthusiasm however Marcus on the other hand expressed this phrase with great enthusiam. He was so cute that we couldn\'t help but giggle and of course this lead to him repeating the words over and over again, causing us to laugh even harder. I knew that I would suffer the consequences of our collective actions and it was only 1 hour later when we were at the video shop and he walked away from me chanting\'go away, go away, go away\'Oh the joys!!
A quick update... 1. My husband\'s health is much, much better. Despite the surgeon\'s ominous prediction that there would be no return of pituitary function, he now has almost full function. The endocrine system is doing great, except for a slightly sluggish thyroid. This is a huge answer to prayer, and I am thankful for all of you who prayed for us. 2. Life has been busy. At times it has been both sad and stressful. I wrote, months ago, about\'deep waters\'. While the waters are not quite as deep as they were, and we\'re not spending as much time in them, they\'re not exactly shallow yet either. 3. We are part of a wonderful fellowship of believers. I can\'t begin to describe what a blessing they has been. Did I mention that these people are wonderful? 4. Life has not been all stress and work. We\'ve carved out time for fun and relaxation too, and made some hilarious family memories...and a few are even captured on video. 5. Coffee is good. Still. Always. That is yet again proof that the natural order of the universe is still intact. 6. I saved the best for last: Offspring #3 (aka,\'the strapping young man\') is ENGAGED!! But it gets even better. He\'s not just engaged to anyone; he\'s engaged to a terrific young woman that people can\'t seem to say enough good things about. We love her! Is that cool or what?
I do love Shaun White. I LOVE that he could have ri,\'en down the center of the pipe and still taken gold, and yet, he put forth the ride of his life and had FUN you nailed it he has fun with what he does. I\'m so bad, I don\'t know anyone\'s name I just get a kick out of watching them all. I don\'t love watching hockey, though because my personal belief is that NHL players shouldn\'t be in the Olympics. I get WHY they opened it up to professional athletes but I don\'t have to LIKE it. I cheer for our American athletes because I\'m an American but I can TOTALLY appreciate the fact the woman\'s snowboarder from Australia put forth a better ride, and be happy for her. (I just would have been happier if an American woman had won) I also totally admire an athlete like the woman\'s skeleton rider, who had a horrific injury, and came back and was able to compete at the Olympic level again.
Today\'s menu: rotini, meat sauce, green beans, cherry-flavored icee, breadstick, butter, milk. I enjoyed this meal. The pasta and meat sauce weren\'t bad and I appreciated the variety of rotini (versus spaghetti). I guess the green beans had some kind of butter sauce. I didn\'t taste a sauce but there was a little buttery residue on the bottom of the paper package. The icee was very sweet. I sucked down a few sips and then stopped. I talked to a couple students about the meal. They said they liked it. I asked if they ate everything and one didn\'t eat the green beans. Both didn\'t eat the breadsticks because they were\'too busy talking\'and ran out of time. In other news I have definitely determined I\'m lactose-intolerant this weekend when I ate some ice cream. So I\'m no longer going to take a milk when I purchase lunch. I could try and take\'lactaid\'with me to work, but it\'s a lot of fuss so I think it\'s just best if I avoid all milk.
Exploring Rheumatoid Arthritis & Pregnancy I\'m a 29 year old nearly-newlywed   and I have rheumatoid arthritis. I was diagnosed just over a year ago, only a few short months after my we,\'ing. It\'s been a bumpy road over the last year, but I am finally at a point where my health is in fairly good shape and I am essentially in remission (meaning I have limited swelling, pain and fatigue). But, that remission comes at a cost. That being some serious medications.
To balance out the disappointing preschool stuff, I should mention that both boys are making unprecedented progress at home and ABA. Yesterday the ABA therapists said that they\'d tried G. on matching words to pictures, and he seemed to get it. He won\'t do picture-matching tasks-- we think he just doesn\'t see the point. They also started working on writing letters. When they originally tried to get him to trace letters, he got very upset, I guess because it was messing up a perfectly good letter. But writing his own letter isn\'t so upsetting, or so we hope! B. is singing up a storm. He is stuck on the line\'the mommies on the bus go\'shush, shush, shush\', for whatever reason (??), and he also keeps repeating\'I like to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas\'. Either one of those things would have seemed impossible a few months ago. And with some encouragement, he\'ll point to the sentence strips I have around the kitchen and mutter,\'Wan nuk (milk), peezh\'or\'Wanna cookie\'. That is really, really amazing for me to hear.
Interleague baseball was first proposed in the 1930s. It took some 60 years for the first game to be played. What took so long? The answer lies in the traditionalist heart. The first Interleague game was in 1997, and was the brainchild of the owners to boost attendance and revenue. And although it gives us fans an opportunity to see players we wouldn\'t normally get to see, I\'m going to go on record as saying I don\'t love Interleague games. Maybe I\'m not a fan because I\'m bitter that the American League dominates. Last year, the AL enjoyed a combined 149-103 edge. Boo! Or maybe I feel it takes away from the uniqueness of the All-Star Game or, more importantly, the drama of the World Series. Or maybe it is just a combination of all of it. I was reading Mark Newman\'s article on MLB.com today and learned that Interleague attendance just keeps growing. Mark states,\'Total Interleague attendance has risen every year from 2002-08, going from 7,741,496 over 249 dates in 2002 to a little shy of one full ballpark under 9 million in 2008.\'Also in this article, Bud Selig is quoted as saying,\'As long as I\'m here, we will have Interleague Play. I love it.\'(Hmmm. My other least favorite thing in baseball -- home field advantage in the World Series based on the All-Star Game winner -- was introduced by Selig, too. Hmmm. But I digress.) Baseball attendance is down four percent this year, in my opinion, due to the economy. Baseball officials disagree, claiming that attendance is down due to the fact that the new Yankee Stadium and Citi Field each have 15,000 fewer seats. Whatever the reason, it will be interesting to see if the attendance for the scheduled Interleague games this season continues, on trend, to grow, or if Interleague attendance also declines. If regular season Interleague baseball is here to stay, there is something that has been proposed numerous times before by players, sports journalists and fans that I really think would make Interleague games more interesting. Play by the visiting team\'s league rules. For instance, if you are playing in a National League park against an American League team, use the designated hitter rule so that fans who don\'t normally get to see the other league\'s style of ball in their stadium get to see it first-hand. Just an idea. What are your thoughts on Interleague Play? Peace, Love, And Baseball, Alyssa
OK, time to remind oneself I support the Hollywood writers\' strike. (Grumble.) I do, I really do. (Grumble.) I\'m not a huge TV watcher, but I\'m really starting to miss this season\'s hot new drama ó and my newest fave ó Cane. The show is about the trials and tribulations of a rich and powerful Cuban-American family, and I was hooked from the very first episode. New episodes of Cane have been noticeably absent, along with those of most other intelligent, well-written shows, for several weeks now. In their place: reality shows, tired re-runs, third-rate movies, and other drivel. Surely viewers are revolting. I\'m surprised there haven\'t been riots in the streets. With two fizzled awards shows and pending Oscar disaster, Hollywood screenwriters are demonstrating the strength inherent in being able to collectively withdraw labour. This dispute is about the same issues that continue to concern Canadian writers. Movies and television make billions of dollars for producers and investors, and secondary digital uses such as DVDs and Internet downloads a,\' to the windfall. Writers want the right to share in the profits generated by material they have created ó a not unreasonable position. Industry executives aren\'t budging and negotations broke down in December. The strike\'s economic costs, both direct and trickle-down, are skyrocketing daily. With the Oscars pending, pressure is surely mounting for all parties to kickstart the stalled bargaining process. They writers will win this thing. They have to.
As his body weakened, it was as if Mark grew even stronger. The last few times I visited him, I felt as if I were standing on holy ground. Jesus shown that brightly through Mark. It sounds cliche...but it was true. One local news story reported that Mark Ri,\'ering\'lost his battle with Lou Gehrig\'s disease\'. That doesn\'t seem accurate. From what I know, and what I\'ve heard from his family and friends, Mark finished the race, the long tiring marathon of the last 15 years, and he finished it well. He fought the good fight. He kept the faith. He persevered to the end. The prize is now his. He didn\'t lose; he won. Tomorrow I have the awesome yet sad privilege of attending the funeral of a true hero of the faith. Mark Ri,\'ering has left behind an awesome legacy. I cannot help but think that Jesus greeted him with the words,\'Well done, my good and faithful servant.
Last spring, Noah (Ethan\'s pistol of a little brother) wanted to do karaoke at are local amusement park. We said that he\'d have to learn a song, practice, and then he could do it. To our surprise, Ethan told us that he wanted to do it too. Ethan loves to sing and watch American Idol, but I was surprised that he wanted to go up on stage and perform. He\'s done plays at school and always learns his lines/songs, but it was hard to get a read from him as to whether or not he enjoyed the process. It seemed like he did. He learned a song (David Cook\'s light on) and they both did a great job. Then last month a school notice went home about the school talent show. Little Noah loves an audience and said that he wanted to do the show. Ethan, once again said that he\'d like to be in it too. They formed a trio with their friend Jake, practiced with the whole crowd of kids for 3 weeks, and performed\'Just One Person\'from Snoopy the musical. It\'s quite moving to think about Ethan enjoying performing. I always enjoyed performing and I think I\'d have a hard time explaining why I liked it so. I liked the process. I liked having audience reaction. I wonder what it is? But in any case both my boys enjoy it too. I\'ll also admit, I\'m quite emotionally moved that my little boy who wouldn\'t turn his head at his name, who didn\'t call me \'mommy\' until 4 1/2 years old, and who seems to spend so much of his time in his own little world enjoys performing and did a wonderful job at the school talent show. I\'m so proud of both of them.
How would you describe time? Does it fly by too fast or stand still? Do you know \'where the time went?\' It\'s hard to believe we\'re already a decade into the 21st century! Ten years ago, we had concerns about Y2K and how it would wreak havoc on the world. Now we\'re dropping the double zero\'s as we head into the year, \'twenty-ten.\' Like it or not, the clock continues to tick, ringing in a new year every 365 days. Do any of you have January birthdays? I do. In a,\'ition to celebrating a new year, in the coming days, I\'ll be a,\'ing another year to my life. That\'s a good thing, I guess. It\'s a whole lot better than the alternative! With the passage of another year, many of us reflect on the years gone by and the milestones of our lives. We often revisit the days of our past and wonder how we made it this far. Or, we relive an occasion that brought joy to our hearts, causing us to smile once again.
Grrrrrr Those Numbers Are Frustrating!! Try as I might, I don\'t seem to be able to consistently keep my blood glucose level where it\'s supposed to be. Oh, there are always times when I know exactly what I splurged on that shot it up, and I can accept that as a rare occurrence. It\'s when I think I\'ve eaten a really good diabetic meal and still have a high reading that is so frustrating. Hubby thought maybe my testing equipment was just registering high, after we read an article stating that home testing equipment can give results as much as 20% in error. So, just to see what would happen I double tested for several days last week, using the same blood drop with two different testing kits. Sometimes the second one would be lower, and sometimes it would be higher. But both kits consistently showed me too high when it went over the limit my doctor set for me. So I can\'t blame it on the 20% inaccuracy findings. I seem to be particularly susceptible to a glucose rise if I eat most whole wheat breads, something I thought I could have in moderation. So it\'s a small piece of sour dough bread with lunch and occasionally a few whole wheat Melba toast pieces with dinner. And I can only manage a very small amount of fruit, which seems to work better if I eat it first. I guess it gets mixed in with the rest of the meal that way and doesn\'t have a chance to make a big spike of sugar. So, in effect, I eat my dessert first now. So I continue to learn what my body will tolerate and what it will not, and we both read everything we can get our hands on that might help me beat this disease as quickly and completely as possible.
As I\'ve mentioned in a number of my posts, my A,\' spouse and I separated several years ago because I just couldn\'t take dealing with his A,\' issues any more. Even though he had been on medication and in counseling for 10 years, there were still many problems, especially in the area of communication. As our marriage disintegrated, the communications got worse. So when we decided we wanted to try to salvage our marriage, my husband\'s counselor (who also knew me from some joint counseling sessions we had done) suggested that we should try a different approach to communication. Instead of discussing things at any old time, and getting into communications problems constantly, he proposed that we have several formal meetings each week where we would talk about problems and conflicts, matters that might require negotiation, plans, and status -- just like in a business meeting. The rest of the time outside the meetings we would only converse on pleasant topics -- like social chit-chat, or anything else we both enjoyed, unless it was something exceptionally urgent (like,\'the house is on fire\'). The intent was to create a context for my husband to be able to focus his attention on the items we needed to discuss, while freeing him the rest of the time from having to try to pay attention when his mind was already engaged with something else. With some reservations on both sides, we began scheduling meetings and trying to work within this framework. I found it frustrating to\'hold off\'talking about matters that arose that were important to me, until our meeting -- when I see a problem, I want to tackle it NOW! -- and my husband initially had trouble with being prepared for the meetings, but we adjusted after a couple of months. Business meetings are usually set for definite periods of time, and we quickly learned that we needed to do the same -- at first, my husband could only maintain focus for an hour at best. Often that meant that topics got deferred to a later meeting, which was very frustrating for me. But as we became more practiced, he was able to increase his focus time, so this problem eventually went away. Normally, people don\'t yell at each other in a business meeting, it\'s unprofessional -- at first we didn\'t implement this concept in our meetings, and we ended up with some meetings being just one concentrated yelling spree. Since my husband can\'t think at all when he gets upset, our discussions were going nowhere, so we adopted this business policy as well. This was very difficult for me to implement, since I\'m an impatient angry sort of person by nature, but it was well worth it since the reduction of the emotional tension made it much more possible for my husband to apply his mind to the subjects at hand. Other problems arose: my husband took few notes, and so some of things we\'d talk about never got\'on his radar screen\'for follow-up; when he took notes, they were often so vague that he\'d misinterpret them later on and then we\'d be at o,\'s about what had been discussed; and worst, he\'d forget the date/time and not show up, or show up late (even though we created a regular schedule!!). These were serious roadblocks, and it took some pretty hard work to deal with them. To help my husband take better notes, we\'d compare notes at the end of each discussion, or at the end of the meeting, to make sure we had both captured the same information -- he would read back his notes, and I\'d identify any discrepancies with mine, and then we would mutually resolve the discrepancies. In the process of making sure we were\'on the same page\', we\'d also be able to ensure that his notes were more detailed and less vague. As far as the lateness/forgetting problem went, we agreed to implement a rule that if he failed to renegotiate a meeting date/time ahead of time, and was late or a no-show, that the meeting would be rescheduled at *my* convenience (but I had to be fair and not just schedule a bad time for him as\'pay-back\'). There were other policies we found useful to implement, through trial and error. Since it wasn\'t certain there would be enough time to cover everything, we decided to cover\'logistical\'topics first (e.g., who has what appointments coming up this week, who is picking up the dry cleaning when, etc.), then topics where some decision was necessary, project status, and such, and finally more nebulous topics that involve some negotiation or conflict or exploration. Before we instituted the meetings, my husband often felt that I was always the one driving the discussions, so to avoid that we developed a policy that we would a,\'ress his agenda before mine (not necessarily his entire agenda -- but his logistics before mine, his project status before mine, etc.) When my husband would agree to take on some task in our meetings, he\'d make notes about it but wouldn\'t necessarily set a particular target date -- and without a target date, he would have no reminder alarm in his PDA or anywhere else, so it often wouldn\'t get done -- so now we set up a target date in the meeting as well. When I would ask for status on some item that he was supposed to be working on, he\'d sometimes have a hard time remembering what he was supposed to have been doing, and it slowed down our meetings a lot to go over it -- so now he does a brief review of his notes of the previous meeting before we start each new one. We fi,\'led with the frequency of our meetings at times, but generally have found that three times a week works best for us. We both sometimes relapse into bad old habits, but we now have the mechanisms in place to correct those problems when they occur. Once we ironed out these wrinkles (after about six months), we found that the meetings not only accomplished their intended purposes of providing a structured context for discussion and negotiation plus better interactions outside the meetings, but they some pleasant unexpected results as well. My husband has become much better at follow-through, because he knows there will be a status check in an upcoming meeting, and this has reduced my need to nag. I\'ve learned how to a,\'ress conflicts without yelling (well, most of the time). We have a much more structured dynamic for communications, which leads to fewer misunderstandings. My husband\'s note-taking has improved so greatly that we rarely need to do re-caps anymore, which shortens the meetings and again contributes to better follow-through. And the meetings as we have set them up provide a method for coming back to unresolved problems, with the chance to review the notes and reflect during the intervening time -- this has been an important element in reaching an accord on many of the more fundamental complex problems surrounding A,\' behaviors. I\'ve resisted the urge to end with a bullet-list summary of\'rules\'for setting up such meetings: this kind of setup should not be a straight-jacket, and I think that each couple has different problems and therefore needs for different rules which only they can discover as they work through this kind of process themselves. I think the only real rule is the original intent -- to create a context for focused attention on interpersonal matters, and to exclude those discussions from the rest of your interactions. This isn\'t a perfect system -- it doesn\'t always work smoothly every time -- but it\'s a very helpful framework. Suffice it to say that these meetings were a key component in ending our separation -- I really don\'t know if we could have resolved our communications problems without them -- and we have found them so helpful, we are still holding them more than four years later! They can definitely be a powerful tool in the A,\'-coping toolbox.
School lunch costs me $3.00 per day. I don\'t carry cash. The cash part of this\'experiment\'has been pretty challenging. I do carry bills, but they are usually twenties and disappear quickly. Open your wallet. Do you have three singles? Would you be able to acquire single dollar bills for every lunch this week? It\'s been o,\'ly difficult for me. The lunch ladies don\'t make change. I have shown up with a $5 and they give me a look like I think they are some kind of shiny ATM. Grudgingly they find the money, but I often have to wait for it. So since starting this project, I have had to be creative with my money. I\'ve borrowed money from my husband (indefinite loan). I\'ve stopped at businesses and bought random things just for the change. One day I stopped at Star*bucks before work and bought a drink. I never do this by the way. I asked the barista,\'Can I have change in dollars?\'He asked me,\'You need it for the tolls?\'I stammered with a smile,\'Yeah, basically.\'I\'m sure he knew I was lying, but I didn\'t want to get stuck in a long discussion not to mention my concern about my anonymity (there might be other teachers waiting for their cappuccinos). I mean, what do people need singles for? The only thing I can think of is going to a strip club. Mr. Barista was left wondering what I was up to. I certainly look like an exhausted working mother -- not the kind of gal gearing up to go to Chip*n*Dale\'s.
Today\'s menu: meatloaf, bread, fruit cup, mystery greens (!), milk To qualify for the label\'meatloaf\'I think meat should be baked in a loaf pan and then sliced. So given that definition, it is obvious that what I ate today is not meatloaf, but instead a meat patty. And I was so thrilled to see what I assumed to be spinach!! I was floored. But then when I took a bite they were so very bitter. After work I chatted with my mom about it and she thinks they are collard greens. Frankly, it looks like spinach. But I\'m not sure it was. All I can say is that this was the first time I could not finish my veggies during this experiment. I had three bites of the most bitter greens I have ever tasted. Can someone enlighten me as to what I ate? So basically I ate the meat and the bread for lunch. A,\'itionally, yesterday\'s\'day-glo\'cornbread muffin was normal colored in real life. There are flourescent lights in school and I also use a cell phone camera so I guess that made it look funny. The picture didn\'t look very distorted to me though.
Wow, what a weekend!!! Let me start off by saying that we will NEVER fly using Southwest Airlines ever again! All 17 of us flew out of Islip Airport in Long Island on Thursdays and arrived in Chicago at Midway Airport. My sister in law, Eileen, and her husband\'s 2 suitcases, missing and NEVER arrived for the whole weekend. They had to go out and buy clothes for the we,\'ing (which they were reimbursed for) and then yesterday, lets see.... finding out that one of Eileen\'s bags had been found in Florida, my other sister in law, Kerry\'s boyfriend\'s luggage not arriving with his flight, my brother in law, Christopher (THE GROOM\'S) luggage not making it to their honeymoon destination and to top it off, they lost Joey\'s carseat!!! Keep in mind, on the way home, there was 3 different flights and on each flight, someone lost luggage. And I wouldn\'t have been so mad about our\'s, but come on, a car seat?! Thankfully, they had loaner carseats so we were able to go home and also thankfully, Joey\'s carseat was found by the time my in-laws flew in last night so they were able to bring his carseat home with them and Southwest Airlines is going to pay to have the loaner carseat FedEx\'ed back to them.
One day last week I wore a pair of pants to work that I bought for $5 (online and on sale). I love to get a bargain when I shop for clothes. I know full well that I\'ll probably get a year out of them and that\'ll be it. It has taken me most of my life to realize that there are things that you buy on sale and things that you spend more on. Over the past year I took stock of my shoes and realized that I had bought too many\'for the right price\'and too few for their quality. When I analyzed how many pairs I actually wore and why, I figured out that my favorite pairs are high quality shoes I spent a lot of money on. So I threw out all the pairs that don\'t fit right or my foot jiggles in or the ones that rub my ankle raw if I don\'t wear them with socks (inevitably I forget that fact and wear them to work without socks). I spend the whole day on my feet so quality shoes are a priority. Then I bought myself a couple new pairs that cost me a lot, but I realize the high cost up front pays off: my back and feet don\'t hurt! My husband and I are the rare duo that both enjoy food shopping and we buy quality food. We are lucky to be able to splurge on little indulgences and bigger ones sometimes too. For our family, organic options matter. I enjoy cooking (my husband doesn\'t know how to cook, but he can boil water) and shopping is the natural extension of that experience. We\'re passing on a love of food to our kid and we make sure to buy the best that we can afford. Why can\'t we give all children the best possible food we can find while they are at school? Why do they have to get the cheapest stuff? If their health and wellness is truly a priority, then we need to pony up and find a way to feed them as if they matter. Children are not\'little adults.\'They are learning and growing every day (I\'m only growing out not up). There are some things you spend extra money on and that would be this nation\'s kids.
Like I said in a previous post, there will be some gaps in school lunch consumption in February. So instead of my usual lunch post, I\'m sharing a photo I took of a vending machine that I saw at a different school. When I walked by the vending machine, I was taken aback. It was visually shocking. What you see are lots of pop*tarts on the bottom, rice*krispie*treats on the top, and some generic peanut butter cracker/cookie sandwiches. I felt obligated to take a picture of the vending machine because it startled me. I did it as discreetly as I could and I tried to keep moving so I don\'t know how much the items cost. I should also say that there was another vending machine nearby that held the usual assortment of chips, chocolate, and candy. Many schools have given up vending machines due to the belief that they are making children obese. I think there are many kids who eat unhealthy foods right after school. If you have a vending machine snack that has upwards of 200 calories every single day after school, you will start to gain weight. I was trying to find more articles about vending machines in the schools. What I did find were some companies that are trying to develop healthy vending machines. I personally like this idea a lot. What do you think? Is there such a thing as a\'healthy\'vending machine? Here are a couple companies that I located online:
Today\'s menu: Rib-a-cue, whole wheat bun, corn, apple, (milk). So the\'rib-a-cue\'looks bad, but when I opened the package, it smelled terrific and it actually tasted really good. Today I was offered a choice (!!) of the rib-a-cue or lasagna. I didn\'t see the lasagna sitting out so I decided on the rib-a-cue, which was sitting in a big stack for the kids to take. I\'m starting to become friends with the lunch room personnel. I was always nice to them before but we\'re definitely establishing a relationship! Someone commented that I\'m eating lunch everyday.... if they only knew the whole story!
Yesterday Mr Man was\'not fine\'. He was very ill in fact. He was banging his head on his pillow in an effort to get the voices to stop. He didn\'t even hear me talking to him and seemed unaware of my presence until I put my arm around him. He told me he had to get on with his\'work\'again, and he had to mark himself with his number - 4064. I was worried that he was going to carve it into his arm with a knife or something. Later he got out\'the folder\'. The folder has paper in it, and that is where he writes his\'codes\'and things like that -\'work\'that the voices have given him to do. He hasn\'t got the folder out since 2004. I couldn\'t believe his symptoms had deteriorated so much in such a short space of time, but I knew what the trigger was - we were supposed to be going out that evening to commemorate the death of Christ, and he was very anxious about it. Needless to say, we didn\'t go. Mr Man is still unwell today, but much better than yesterday, and typically he doesn\'t remember much of yesterday. I say\'typically\'because it is quite common for Mr Man to be unable to remember periods when he has been acutely ill. He\'s been a little unwell for a while now though. Just a couple of weeks ago he spoke to his Occupational Therapist about how he was feeling. She was concerned enough to start visiting him every couple of days, and she even gave him her mobile phone number in case of a crisis, but he didn\'t want to talk to me about how he was feeling. I didn\'t mind; I understood that he doesn\'t like me to worry about him, and to be honest I was just glad that he was talking to someone instead of keeping it all to himself.
I have not intentionally given up blogging. We are simply at a point where living our lives is taking up all of our energy. There is progress going on, and there is also a lot of poop, peanut butter, toothpaste, urine and other stuff to clean up. We are having lots of fun in general, but it\'s a very energetic type of fun! Lots of chasing boys across soccer fields, through Target, and so forth. I always wondered what would happen when they got too big for strollers and shopping carts and now I know. I like to think my cardio vascular health must be getting great. Hope to return to blogging before too long.
Hi Kristyn! I thought this was a really well done blog on sensory integration dysfunction. I will pass it on to others. I found out last year that my son is very sensory seeking. I had never heard of sensory integration concerns before my son started exhibiting signs of this dysfunction, and it was a very confusing time for me. I wish I had gone on-line and connected with others! Currently, I am trying to raise awareness about SPD through our book I Can Be: A Child\'s Whimsical Introduction to Yoga. I have been practicing this book with my son since he was a baby and little did I know that it was a great tool for his sensory concerns. A percentage of our proceeds goes to a local nonprofit dedicated to preventing developmental delays through education. If you get a moment, we also have a blog, our website is www.qandjbirdpress.com. I look forward to reading more of your blogs.
Our special children, these bright and creative ADHD children, can be such a challenge to parent. We watch them bounce around in our neuro-typical world, stumbling and falling more than their peers. We want to fix it and make it all better, as though ADHD is just a boo-boo, but it\'s not and we can\'t. At some point, we come to accept that it can\'t be changed. We even come to accept ADHD into our lives and our families and focus on the gifts despite ADHD. We focus on our children\'s talents and their accomplishments and love them unconditionally. But we worry about their futures too, the time when they are no longer under our wing and must learn to soar on their own. My son often gives me glimpses of his future and lets me know he\'s going to be okay. Not just okay, but great even. Quite often these glimpses are hi,\'en in the most brief moments of peace and joy. These times when I am observing him and I am not worried but content and joyful. When he creates something unique, says something insightful, or achieves something so easy for his peers, I can peek into his future and be satisfied. That little moment when I realize I am at peace with ADHD.
I wondered whether you may be able to offer some advice. I\'m an Occupational Therapist working for the NHS in Sheffield;UK. A group of professionals have started to plan an ADHD group for Adults and we are generally involved in developing a service for this client group (very little support available currently). We are struggling to find information / research / examples of groups which we can learn from. We have a number of ideas including using psychosocial and behavioural interventions and have flirted with the idea of incorporating a sensory integration approach. However we are concerned about the little evidence on sensory integration and ADHD. My question to you is this: Can you point me in the direction of any evidence / journal name or particular paper /examples of good practise / contact name /  .etc for Adult support groups and Sensory Integration. If you do   I\'ll think yer amazing and tell all my colleagues about how wonderful you are!!! Does this encourage you?!* Anyway thanks for the website   it\'s already proved very useful and I look forward to reading the updates, Liz.
One of those men was Mark Ri,\'ering. We barely knew him when he helped us move, but that didn\'t stop him from eagerly volunteering to help. As we got to know him...well, I have to admit that he sometimes made me feel like I did when I was a little girl and hero-worshiped a heroic policeman. Mark Ri,\'ering was a good cop. He was a true hero. He was also one of the sweetest, kindest men I\'ve ever met. I loved watching him interact with his kids, loved watching how he looked at them, how he played with them, how he so obviously cherished them and his wife. He enjoyed life...enjoyed his family...enjoyed his many, many friends. I don\'t think I\'ll ever forget his smile or his laugh. We knew Mark during the time when he began noticing troubling symptoms, and when he received the diagnosis of ALS. He was an important part of the weekly Bible study that first met in his home and later in ours. We all watched him walk through this time of uncertainty. If he felt sorry for himself, we never knew it --- his concern was always for his family...and that he would be found faithful in God\'s eyes. Over the months and years, we watched his big strong body deteriorate. Never once did we hear him complain. Instead, we still heard him laugh and still enjoyed his smiles, his loving concern for our family, and his sense of humor. He encouraged others over and over again.
Showing Improvement Well, I\'ve been on the antibiotics and other meds that my Gastro put me on for over a week now, and I\'m beginning to see progress. I still have problems with my tummy, but the constant feeling of nausea is gone ... and good ri,\'ance! We wrapped all the presents and filled the stockings last night, so we\'re all ready to enjoy the next few days with our family. We\'ll all be together this Christmas, and that always makes it extra special. Some years we have to share our daughter with her in-laws, which is only fair, but I\'m glad she and her hubby will be celebrating with us this year. We\'ve had a particularly rewarding Christmas this year already, helping a large number of families find replacements for lost or bedraggled lovies for Santa to put under their Christmas trees! We\'ve received wonderfully excited thank you\'s from many of them, and each time one was received it just made this Christmas that much more meaningful. It can\'t be said often enough that it really is more enjoyable to give than to receive!! My hope and prayer is that you have a Christ filled Christmas this year, too!
According to my psychiatrist SID is a dysfunction disorder under A,\'/ADHD. I found a site about it, after researching why I had such sensativity to smell, sound and touch. The sight calls it Sensory Processing Disorder, instead of SID, now. There are different check list pages to see if you or a loved one might meet the criteria. When I did it, I was amazed. I met almost everything. Its very interesting, I wondered, since I take A,\' medication if that could actually make the sensory sensitivity worse. I also have PTSD. But after 9 years of being misdiagnosed, I am happy to be functioning pretty well with the A,\' medication. As long as I dont let a rebound effect take over, I metabalize the stuff fast, and that even if it is XR. I can also take a Clonazapam to relieve my oversensitivity at those times. For me the A,\' medication, while still activly working in my brain, even makes the SID normal. All of the meds and diagnosis are tricky and time consuming, plus alot of trial and error and if lucky a positive!!
I supported it. Frankly, I never thought I\'d live to see the day when people would try to redefine the institution of marriage and would then try to impose their ideas on others, even to the point of forcing all couples getting marriage licenses to have to be identified as\'Party A\'or\'Party B\', rather than as bride and groom. When su,\'enly marriage has become about something completely different than what it has always been understood to be...when it is no longer about a bride and groom, but about two\'parties\'...well, I finally decided enough was enough when it comes to people trying to impose their new definition of marriage on all of society and on our legal system. This social experimentation had gone too far. Some time back, I wrote this: Save Marriage!! Defend Marriage!! I still think that the greatest threats to marriage come from within marriage itself. We are the ones who threaten our own marriages, through all manner of sin, whether it be just plain selfishness and irresponsibility, or lust, adultery, pornography, abuse...the list goes on. I wish more of us were willing to spend our time, money and effort vocally and effectively fighting those very real threats against marriage. But, in the meantime, I helped my son get signs put out. I spoke out where and when I could. And, sometime over the next few weeks, I hope to blog about why this issue is so crucial to me, and why it should be crucial to you as well...and why we need to speak out now.
Well, I finally did it! I\'m out of the stock sites. As some of you know, I have been experimenting with selling my artwork online through half a dozen stock photography and microstock sites for a couple of years. While they were generating income, the experience has never been ideal. Uploading was time-consuming, especially with so many sites. It was frustrating to have certain sites reject an image for utterly arbitrary reasons, while others accepted the very same image. And I certainly didn\'t enjoy giving away 50% of my income to these companies for the privilege of hosting my art. I felt none did a good job of marketing or promoting my work. I had already had my own site, Fractallicious, up and running for about a year, functioning primarily as a signpost to direct interested people to the various stock sites and other places, such as CafePress, where they could buy my fractal art. Fractallicious was successful in that regard, but once potential customers landed on one of the stock sites I had sent them to, I became a tiny fish in a huge ocean of competitors. Income trickled in in dribs and drabs. So I set out to be my own stock site. Turns out, I sadly under-estimated the challenge involved in turning a static web site into a full-blown ecommerce application. It\'s been a long tough slog, with numerous technical difficulties, but we\'re finally there! The company we chose, Volusion.com, provides a turnkey ecommerce platform, allowing you to create an online store with a powerful database back-end, shopping cart, and merchant account services. The Volusion technology is robust, complex, and highly configurable. Because of this very complexity, it\'s also far from intuitive and comes with a steep learning curve. The company scores an A+ for the superb quality of their 24/7 technical support. So, starting this week, I have eliminated the mi,\'leman! (And, no, this is NOT an April Fool\'s joke.) I\'m partnering with my sister on this endeavour, and we\'re not only selling gorgeous (if I say so myself) high-quality image downloads, but also certain images printed on a variety of merchandise, CafePress-style. My rainbow designs have been very popular with the gay and lesbian community, and we\'re starting with three of them printed on 1\'buttons, and attractively packaged as a three-pack for gift giving. Drop by Fractallicious.com, and have a look. If you like what you see, please feel free to spread the word!
By A Customer My husband was diagnosed with an extremely severe case of colitis then Crohn\'s disease. All that his doctors were doing were prescribing higher and higher doses of drugs (sulfasalazine, prednisone, etc.) which were making him sick and caused him to drop pounds daily. Then we heard about Elaine Gottschall\'s book. It has literally been a life saver!!! The author provides both an explanation for the diet and a simple guide of\'do eat\'and\'don\'t eat\'foods in list form. My husband felt like he had his symptoms under control within two days! He was able to stop taking his medications with no complications. At last, no more stomachaches. After two years of being on this diet, my husband has shown remarkable improvement after follow up tests. However, don\'t expect your doctors to support this diet, they don\'t want to give up their hold on prescribing expensive prescription drugs! Even more unbelievable, the specialists we\'ve seen are completely ignorant of this book! Incredible. This diet is completely natural and relatively easy to follow, especially considering the alternatives! Buy this book for yourself or for your loved one who suffers from this disease. It can change lives. We cannot thank Elaine Gottschall enough.
Most people have heard about the holiday blues, but not many have heard of the holiday flares. For those of us with rheumatoid arthritis this time of year can be the beginning of very painful season. There are many contributing factors to why you may experience a flare during the holidays; bad eating, stress and depression, just to name a few. Your RA symptoms may increase due to these factors and can make what should be a great holiday into a flare to remember. The fact is we can not always control our symptoms, but we can make choices to help avoid the pitfalls of pain. The most important tip that I can give you is to slow down. There are a million things to do and not enough time to do them. So, keep it simple. Your house doesn\'t have to look like a Christmas museum in order to feel festive!
Yesterday was the last day of winter break. Our two boys had some gift certificates to spend at a local book store. When my husband and I saw I Don\'t Want to Go to School written and illustrated by Stephanie Blake, we had to get it. I didn\'t read the book first and now regret buying it because it\'s really too young for us. The hero, Simon, seems to be a kindergartner who is afraid to go to school. The guy we were thinking of is eleven and in the fourth grade. Also, unlike the hero, my guy has autism and his problems with school go way beyond anxiety. (He just doesn\'t like it, and we\'re still trying to figure out why.) Anyway, by the end of the story, Simon decides he likes school so much he doesn\'t want to leave. That is great, but it makes me wish that was the case with my child. He always wants to come home!!! Don\'t get me wrong. The book is cute. My six year old liked it a lot when I read it to him, though it seemed a bit young even for him, let alone my eleven year old. I also noticed something a bit off about the book. It\'s a picky point, but Blake depicts Simon writing his name in cursive on one of the pages. This is something a second or third grader might do, but certainly not a kindergartner on his first day at school! Further, there are signs all over the kindergarten room on one page in the book. All the signs written in cursive. I\'ve been in many a kindergarten room and usually all the signs are printed. So, that is another thing my son does not have in common with Simon. He might not ever write in cursive. It\'s hard enough for him to print his name. C1\'s team at school and I think his problems with school might have to do with writing. My team and I learned about how to solve writing related problems at START. Hopefully, I\'ll blog about the topic of hand writing soon. As far as this book goes, it seems most appropriate for young children who are just about to enter primary school (though I like Wemberly Worried, a similar book, by Kevin Henkes a bit better). Blake\'s pictures are bright and cheerful and the story depicts Simon having a lot of fun at school, but as a mom of older children I wish I had passed on this one for something more age appropriate.
That\'s what he would call himself. When I met him online, he was pastoring a tiny little church in some little Texas town. But he was one of the smartest men I know, with a mind that would never forget anything. The first few things I found out about him is that he loved Jesus, loved his family, loved teaching, had a special place in his heart for mothers and babies, and was hilarously funny. Eventually I found out he had put together a lengthy series of lessons from the Bible dealing with a certain topic in a way that infuriated me, scared me...and then set me free from a lifestyle and church that was sucking my soul -- and the souls of my family -- dry. It sounds trite and corny, but this man changed my life. Sometimes I\'d tease him that he ruined my life. I\'d say,\'Here I was, happily living a life of crushing rules and regulations that I kept failing at, until you came along and ruined my life with all your talk of grace, freedom, and joy.\'I only met him once in person, but it was one of those unforgettable visits that our family still talks about, over a decade later. He and his wife became\'Uncle Mike and Aunt Marilyn\'to our family. We fell in love with their adorable baby boy. We spent a lot of time talking and laughing. They felt like long lost family. Just a little bit ago I got the news:\'Mike has been promoted to Heaven.\'I can\'t help but think that Jesus greeted him with the words,\'Well done, my good and faithful servant. Enter now into the joy of your rest.
I have been losing chunks of memories. I have been experiencing it much too much lately and so I went to see a psychiatrist who told me that achalasia or my anemia could be part of it. He told me to see my primary care physician and ask him to recommend a neurologist. I am going to do it. I have an appointment to go see my Doc this afternoon. In the meantime I did some research and here is what I found. Read the entire article. Warning: You may need a medical dictionary to decipher some of the article. The following quote is just a very small bit. But it is important to read the whole thing and maybe one of you readers can tell me what you got out of it. Maybe I misunderstood it.\'The corollary to this is that loss of argyrophilcells may have the same clinical effect as totalneuronal fall-out.
At my school the kids get 20 minutes for lunch, which is bell-to-bell time. So lunch time includes waiting in line, getting your items, finding a seat, opening your food packages, EATING, throwing out your trash, and lining up to go back to class. If they don\'t finish it all, they have to throw it away. Taking food back to the classroom is not allowed. I think kids get about 12-13 minutes to eat maximum if everything goes as planned. If their class is the last to get into line, well, they might have as little as 5 minutes sitting at the table. Well, it just doesn\'t seem like enough time to eat. It\'s hard enough for the teachers to grab a bite in 20 minutes. After taking the kids to the cafeteria, getting my meal together (using the microwave), chatting with a teacher, and using the bathroom, I might have about five minutes to eat. Also the food prepared in the school cafeteria is very often meant to be eaten by hand. So that\'s pretty easy to do in 5-10 minutes. It can\'t be utensil-friendly fare if you only get a spork. I personally can wolf down food when necessary, but I am an adult. Imagine a little person who maybe eats a little more slowly than an adult. Do they actually eat very much in 5 minutes? I guess my wish is that all kids get 30 minutes to eat. Lunch is about learning too; it\'s not just filling an empty stomach (and sometimes they don\'t even have a chance to do that). Lunch is a break for students to chat with their friends in an informal setting. Learn about foods and enjoy eating.
When you and your spouse are first exploring whether or not ADHD has been a factor in your marriage it can seem both a relief (finally, a reason that explains so much!) and a bit overwhelming (ADHD seems to be everywhere!) Some with ADHD resist thinking about how much ADHD can impact their relationship because it makes them feel\'broken\'or lessened. I asked myself the other day - does it matter if you label it ADHD? The answer to that question is yes and no. Knowing about ADHD really helps you find the optimal way to improve your life. But you don\'t have to\'label\'it ADHD in your everyday life. Here\'s an example: For years my husband and I laughed because he is a man who needs to exercise pretty much every day else he can be cranky, unhappy, disconnected and hard to live with (and also doesn\'t sleep as well). We now realize that this is related to his ADHD and that exercise is one of his forms of\'treatment\'. But does it matter that we now know that it\'s ADHD related? Not really, as long as he\'s exercising. It\'s just HIM and one of the things that is part of him (with an excellent side benefit for me, in that he\'s in great shape!) What does matter is that you (ADHD or not) get a chance to put your life in order in a way that satisfies you and brings you joy. (Note I say YOU here. No one is obliged to satisfy anyone else.) For those with ADHD who are travelling a journey to find out what brings them joy, the label of ADHD is useful insomuch as when you know you have ADHD, then you also know that using specific tactics that are shown to work for people with ADHD is the fastest/best way to get to your goal - and sometimes the only way, given how ADHD works. I always remind people - don\'t try harder, try differently - and by that I mean try those things that are known to work for ADHD because they will work better for you than other approaces simply because of the way you are wired. While it once completely controlled my life and my husband\'s life, ADHD is now almost non-existent in both of our lives and certainly in our marriage. You can\'t imagine how much better things can/will get for you if you are able to think clearly and non-judgmentally about ADHD and what is already known about dealing with it. (And, for those with a learned fear of failure, having faith that good treatment means you don\'t have to continue to wonder whether you\'ll fail at what you try is also helpful...but that\'s a different post!) ADHD is only a curse if you fight the idea of having it more than you fight to subdue it\'s symptoms. Once you subdue the symptoms then you can start to understand the great things that it offers you, as well. For some, those things include minds that move quickly and\'see\'things in unique ways; tenacity (my husband is a good case of this); an ability to love well and forgive quickly (because they live in the moment); almost unending curiosity...the list is very long indeed. There\'s a reason why the only guy for me has ADHD! Everybody else is just too boring!
Today\'s menu: Pepperoni pizza, milk, baby carrots, multi-grain apple mini-crisps, fruit cup. Our first repeat meal! I strongly dislike the pizza so for me this one was a rough. I got excited by the\'mini-crisps\'because I thought they might be dehydrated apple slices, but unfortunately they were rice cake-like disks. I liked the baby carrots, but I asked one of my students if he ate them and he told me,\'No.\'The fruit cup was partially frozen. I did attempt to eat it. NOTE: The second picture is a decent shot of the mini rice cakes. Also you can see the pizza in the background. It\'s got a glassy film on top, which is called cheese. The cheese has separated into two layers, the\'saran*wrap\'layer and then the under layer. Yum.
Disneyland for little D is a mixed bag. He loves the rides but some of it can be a bit overwhelming. From the 6 hour drive to his problems adapting to his new bed, it is a mixed bag for my little one. Overall he had loads of fun though, and we came through another good experience together as a family. If you do decide to try doing this. Here are some tips I think you will find useful (I guess these probably work for any multi-day amusement park outing): * Before you go, think about how your kid is going to sleep. Something that has worked for us is to bring his bedroom fan and the be,\'ing from his bed (his own pillowcase, etc). * Bring his diagnosis with you and stop by Guest Services to get a special needs pass, particularly if your little one has trouble with large crowds of people or standing in lines for a long time. This is a must and boon for the whole family - it makes the park a completely different experience for everyone, and it can help family interactions since it instantly makes him very popular amongst siblings (since he has the pass and can skip lines with his party). * Think about the sensory conditions of the place vis-a-vis your kid. If sensitivity to sound is a problem, lights, proprioceptive input etcetera, and try to match his/her temperament with the conditions of the ride. If your kid has never gone into any rides before, you may want to take him on something that is outdoors and low-key first (this type of ride can also help to relax him afterwards). For example, a favorite \'relaxing\' ride of my son is Heimlich\'s Chew Chew train on California Adventure, which is the Bugs Life character made into a train and goes outdoors inside a giant collection of food - the odors of the different foods (watermelon, animal crackers) permeate the air as the train goes. * Keep close guard on him if he\'s a runner. A crowded mega-park is not the place you want to lose track of your kid, particularly if he\'s nonverbal. Consider using tags or something else with your cell phone on it. If you don\'t have anything, even black marker on his or her belly (\'If lost call (999) 999-9999\') is better than nothing. * Consider your kids\' limited diet. You can bring food into Disneyland. * Find quiet areas of the park as you walk and pick those places to take a break. Take out the food at those times. Also keep track of the nearest bathroom. * Something I noticed and I wished I had done was have lunch in the Tiki Room. Little D loved the room, it relaxes him to watch the birds and hear the music and once even fell asleep inside. You are allowed to eat in there as long as you pick up after yourself, which is great to keep fidgetiness to a minimum. Because there really is no bad seat you can stay outside away from the crowd until the appropriate time comes (you may want to let the attendant know how many are in your party and that you will be doing this) and then just show up. Or if your kid will allow it, enjoy the mini-show in the courtyard. * Take some video, but not too much that you don\'t interact with your kid. Your kid smiling and his eye contact will be priceless to remember.
Well I\'m having very little computer time because unfortunately my laptop is acting up and my hubby is still trying to diagnose the problem so we can get it fixed. I have to steal moments on his PC when I can so I may be sparse, we\'ll see. Now on to the point, Adrian\'s teacher called me today. She wants me to come meet her at the school tomorrow to talk about how we can help Adrian communicate better at home. I\'m assuming she\'s talking PECS, which we know all about, but I\'m hoping and looking forward to any new ideas she has. I NEVER turn down a chance to meet up with the teacher so I wasn\'t about to say that I didn\'t need advice! My conversation with Adrian today: Me: Did you have fun at school today? Adrian: (silence) Me: Did you have fun at school today? Did you play outside? Adrian: Outside! Me: Did you go down a slide today? Adrian: Slide! Swings! Me: Oh you went on the swings today? Adrian: Slide! Swings! Recess! Me: Oh you had recess today? Was that fun? Adrian: (Silence) Well it was some what of a conversation, I\'m pleased!
I went to the doctor today. I have gained one pound in two months. But keep in mind that I\'m no angel outside of work. For example, we just had Valentine\'s Day and I ate a lot some chocolates. I also want to let you know that in December I did have blood taken, I did a sugar fast, and the basic stats were run. At that time I was normal. I did have low HDL (the good cholesterol), but my overall cholesterol is fantastic. Why did I do that? Well, I have awesome insurance that gives healthy adults a yearly discount if I get a physical and basic blood work done (thereby proving my health status). I love the policy because it\'s common sense. Plus it\'s a great way to discover a problem before it turns into something. Preventative versus reactive. It\'s way cheaper to give discounts up front than pay for a major problem five years down the road. When those tests were run, I hadn\'t even fully come up with the idea of the blog so it\'s really fortuitous. Whenever this project ends, I\'ll be able to compare pre- and post-data. That being said I haven\'t been feeling myself recently. I\'m having more stomachaches and that\'s why I visited the doctor. I\'m looking into it and I\'ll keep you updated.
I am a family of people suffering from arthrits. My dad and uncle Tibs\' bodies were so disformed it was pitiful. My hands are swollen mostly in cold weather. I am in pain most of my day. I have been told I would sooner or later have to have hip replacement. HIP REPLACEMENT, this is so scary. I my town all we have are quacks that can\'t be trusted for anything but taking our money. This I know because I have friends who have gone to these doctors. Doctors here think getting old means \'YOU JUST HAVE TO PUT UP WITH IT. I have no way to get to a surgeon that I can trust and you say \'stress\' causes more problems with my arthritis. What am I supposed to do. Thanks for the shoulder.
Doing Great! I\'m really feeling good these days. My stomach is behaving itself, and I\'m encouraged by the strength that is returning to my legs. I was able to manage a couple of fairly steep driveways on our yard sale haunts on our Date Day without using the cane. That\'s quite a victory for me, as I can\'t remember how many years it\'s been since that was true. I\'m gradually a,\'ing back in all the supplements I was taking before my stomach got ulcerated again, and so far there\'s been no stomach problems. That\'s a true blessing. I\'m also encouraged by my ability to learn about the new programming language that our new sites are written in. It\'s slow going, but I am gradually understanding how the code is working. I\'m very proud of that. I\'m still going to sleep most nights at 9:00PM and getting up around 5:00AM, so I\'m getting plenty of sleep. I usually only wake up once in the night to make a bathroom trip, so my bla,\'er is behaving, too. I\'m getting closer to my goal of losing 50 pounds by April 1. I may not hit the date exactly, but I\'m not going to miss it by much. With the lowered rate, and the care hubby takes with his grocery shopping, my blood glucose numbers have been mostly excellent for some time now. Of course, there\'s the occasional high number, but I usually know what I\'ve eaten to cause it, and learn accordingly. All in all, I\'d say I\'m in the best physical and mental state I\'ve been in for years, and I hope it continues.
Thalassemia is another disease that has the heterozygote advantage. This disease is very similar to sickle-cell and it also prevents malaria in heterozygotes. This disease is caused by a mutation and it causes the body to have fewer red blood cells than normal and less hemoglobin. This disease can be deadly at an early age, but in the case of a heterozygote, it can be left untreated, have blood transfusions needed, or just eating healthy. Sickle-cell is found in people of African ancestry, while thalassemia is mostly in people with Italian, Greek, Mi,\'le Eastern, southern Asian and African ancestry.
I am always pushing for the reduction of the stigma surrounding mental illness. It may be my error to think that we have made progress. What I infer from this article is that universities have regressed when it comes to social acceptance of mental illness. This is something that began prior to the horrifying Virgina Tech massacre. Read the article to learn the extremes that are being taken against those that are mentally ill. With statistics like one in four Americans diagnosed with a mental illness, the number requires more mental health support. There are too many people that are not seeking the help they need. The response to the health problem the universities are making for anyone, let alone a huge number of the population, are insufficient. There is a quote in this article from a politician, Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston who is open about his mental illness. I can only hope those voices in important places like his, and those of the entertainment industry like Patty Duke and Carrie Fisher, will continue to speak and unveil the misconceptions. I can only hope.
G\'s latest occupation: holding a number placemat and singing first\'This Old Man\'(one to ten) and then\'There were ten in the bed and the little one said, Roll over\'(ten back down to one). He has found the ultimate, never-ending song! Our college student who comes in the afternoons is out of town, and my sanity is already a fragile thing. I am plotting to go to every store which has the carts which will hold two or three kids (Target, HEB, Randalls, there must be more). I\'ve been working hard on getting them to walk with me in public, but I still need a\'strapping in\'option when I\'ve got all three of them. It feels so strange to me that I can\'t take my kids out by myself. When they were younger and slower-moving, I could, but these days it\'s just not safe. Everyone tells me this will get easier, and I just have to assume they are right!
It\'s a while since my last post and that\'s partly because I didn\'t have a great deal to say and partly because I was busy trying to get my life in order. I now feel as though I\'m making some progress. I mentioned previously that I had been medically retired from my job and, at the age of 53, that wasn\'t really in my plans. Aside from anything else, I\'ve always been a very busy person and I felt as though my days didn\'t have much of a purpose. I had lunch with my former work colleagues last week and that was my \'leaving do\'. It was lovely to see them and they gave me gifts and cards with lots of lovely messages (which made me cry!) but then it finally felt as though that chapter of my life had closed and that I can move on. So, I have applied to the local CAB to do some voluntary work and things have moved really quickly - I have an interview there on Wednesday so fingers crossed! I have also re- started learning Spanish - I began last summer but got distracted and now I\'m trying to make up for lost time. it\'s great because I really feel as though I\'m making progress this time around. I am also wanting to take up a new hobby. I used to do lots of cross-stitch but my hands won\'t allow me to do that any more so I am thinking of trying crochet which is not such fine work. So, we\'ll see how that goes. All in all I feel much more positive about things.
Shaun White is 23 years-old now but only 11 in that clip, same age as my daughter. And   AND!   he was born with a heart defect that required two open-heart surgeries before he turned one. Despite that inauspicious beginning, he started snowboarding when he was six, won his second gold medal in these Vancouver Games, and is the acknowledged master of the sport. Ever watch him compete? With the other snowboarders, both his own American teammates and the riders from other countries, there is sometimes a stiffness in their routines, a nervous quality that comes across even on television. Incredible athletes all, and snowboarding tricks in general demand an uncommon kind of bravery and audacity of movement, but Shaun White\'s fluidity almost makes them look wooden in comparison. When he goes on, he appears to be just playing. His performance is all, \'Hey guys, gonna have a little fun here now, k?\' as he bounces around the halfpipe and, in the tradition of all athletes at the top of their game, makes it look easy.
If you lined up all the teachers and staff in my school in a search for who might possibly write a blog like this, I would be one of the last chosen. In my professional life, I don\'t make waves. I avoid conflict. I\'m a\'yes\'man. I do what I\'m told, but I love my job so it\'s not hard. In my personal life, I\'m more opinionated and although I\'m a deeply private person, I tell my friends and family exactly how I feel. Few coworkers have crossed over into the actual\'real life friend\'category. So it\'s very easy for me to compartmentalize. Before this project happened. Now I\'m feeling majorly exposed. I could absolutely lose my job over this. In just the first ten days of school lunches I\'ve gotten a bigger response than I expected. It makes me nervous. Most teachers do feel the same way that I do about the lunches served in the building. So that\'s reassuring. We\'ve all discussed the lunches and how bad they are in passing. Then we go back to teaching. No one has done much. I\'m not a hero, but I am a whistleblower. But instead of calling a\'tip line,\'I\'ve shouted it to thousands of people. Oops.
SOOOOOOoooo I almost didn\'t make it to the gym tonight. My legs hurt with every step I took today; it didn\'t help that I slept in and got to work late so I had to park way back at the end of the parking lot. In the afternoon I was sitting at my desk and I thought I was having a heart attack because I had chest pains.... then I remembered benching yesterday. By the time I got home I was tired and sore and just a tad bit grumpy. I was making lots of hints that i did not want to go to the gym and I was just waiting for Scott to fold and say lets not go because I didn\'t want to be the one to say it. Well finally at 8:00 he convinced me to get my fat, lazy butt to get up and go and I was already thanking him for making me go five minutes after we got there. Thanks again Scottie so Hottie! Cardio 10 minutes on the elliptical going alternating between one intense minute at level 13 and and one recovery minute at level 6. Try it.... 10 minutes may sound like a piece of cake but when you do intervals and push during those hard minutes it makes a world of difference! Weights-- Planet Fitness has a 30 minute weight circuit with cardio boxes in between each one. We got a full body weight work out and did all kinds of jumping, lunging, squatting, stepping, hopping, and dipping in between. I was very nasty and sweaty which in my book equals a good work out. I highly recommend trying one of these cicuits if you gym has one or you can make your own my planning a workout routine with cardio in between.
So I\'m coming out. I am not plus-sized, but any stretch of the imagination. I am one of those women that\'mommy bloggers\'love to hate: right this moment, at the age of almost 52, I am wearing junior size 5 jeans. This is 12 years after giving birth to the last of my six children. I doubt that any of my three readers will gush,\'Now I love you even more!\'but I refuse to be ashamed of my size. Not any more. I am a real woman. I think that carrying six children to term and breastfeeding them for over a year each -- and having them thrive on the milk my\'inadequate\'body produced -- more than qualifies me for real woman status, no matter what curves I may be lacking. I do not apologize for not being plus-sized, nor do I apologize for not even wanting to be plus-sized. Sigh. I know. I\'m supposed to be worried that my words might be construed as being\'size-ist\'and\'intolerant\', and completely lacking in\'fat acceptance\'. I should instead be an\'advocate for plus-sized women\'. I should drop my head in shame and apologize to people,\'I can\'t help it that I\'m thin. Really. I eat twice as much as you, but I can\'t gain weight no matter how hard I try.\'But, you know what? That is simply not true. The truth is: I exercise. Not fanatically, not three hours each day, not even consistently as much as I should to maintain the best health (e.g., the recommended 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise each day plus strength training to maintain muscle mass and healthy bones at my age). Most days, I don\'t overindulge my appetite. I don\'t bake as a hobby and don\'t consume frequent desserts. The type of food I have grown to enjoy the most is relatively low fat and free of rich, creamy sauces.
Do women really have more severe arthritis than men? Are we more open or honest when answering questionnaires? Or are we just more likely to complain? Those are the questions raised for me by a research study published in the January issue of Arthritis Research and Therapy (and the many subsequent news articles written this week). It\'s long been known that more women develop RA than men, in fact, 70% of people with RA are women. Other gender differences have also been noted. Both men and women have relatively equal disease activity (number of joints affected), damage to joint structure and deformities. However, while men generally have a higher incidence of rheumatoid nodules, higher mortality rates, and are more likely to be RF positive; women generally are more likely to have RA, have more severe symptoms, higher erythrocyte sedimentation (ESR) rates and report greater rates of functional disability and work disability. Other studies have found that men are more likely to have periods of remission. Men have also been shown to have higher response rates to biologic drugs; but on the other hand, they also have higher rates of adverse events and serious infections with those drugs.
Whew! After hours of frustration, I have succeeded in moving this blog\'s template over into New Blogger. I did my best to maintain the same look and feel, but there are subtle differences. (You can see the old template by clicking on the thumbnail at left.) And what a learning curve it\'s been. Hopefully, the results will prove worth it. One of the major benefits of New Blogger (and certainly my primary motivation in upgrading to widgets view) is the new labels/categories feature, evidence of which you can see at right below. Those who have been with me for a while will be familiar with the various not-so-successful code hacks and workarounds I have employed over the years in an effort to give this blog that all-important missing functionality. I posted recently on the changes needed to get the 3-column Minima template that I give away here working properly in New Blogger layout view. That was a piece of cake compared to this blog\'s template, because of all the customization I had done. New Blogger didn\'t like my classic template at all, and the easiest approach to feeding New Blogger widget view something it could digest proved to be to rebuild it from scratch. I started with the 3-column Minima template, but you can only get so far dragging widgets around the screen. To get the functionality and look and feel I wanted, I had to delve into New Blogger\'s XHTML code, which is a whole lot more obtuse and less forgiving than Old Blogger\'s code. (Tip: all tags must be closed, even IMG tags, or they will generate error messages.)
All of my trips to this southern Philippine city had always been for business. My first visit to Cagayan de Oro City, or CDO ,as most Filipinos refer to it, was a decade ago when I was there to hold a training workshop with the local affiliates of the organization where I used to work with. Despite the fact that I had never been to this place during that time, I traveled alone as the advance party; an irony, now that I think about it.
With only the moon and the stars to light our way, we stopped by a souvenir shop that glowed through its fire-lit lamp. The waves were our only reminder of our location. We walked along the beach with our bags in tow and rested at a medium-size open-air hut filled with soft lights. The sound of a big lizard kept our senses alert.
I finally make it to the gate with only twenty minutes to spare. With so little time, it turns out I could have left my purse, book and bottle of water in the car and saved a lot of hassle. My mother comes off the jetway beaming like a little kid; she is so excited to be here. I grab her wheel chair and begin to push, all the while wondering, how after 358 days of travel I could have been caught by security twice. My, how quickly we do forget.
Second-universal health care is not the answer. It\'s a larger problem. Insurance companies have no incentive to save money to those they insure-the hospital passes the increased cost of the uninsured onto the insured. Hospitals should start incentives to pay in cash. Why should they bill you more if you pay in cash than they do the insurance company?
The weather in this part of the globe is once again changing. The slight chill in the air has ebbed away and Philippine summer seems to be entering earlier than expected. It\'s not really a su,\'en shift because in our tropical country, weather conditions could be rainy, normal (dry and warm), and warmer.  Most of the time, the sun would be out.
But by last week everything had changed. I received an email from someone named Corie which I was about to delete since I didn\'t know a Corie and certainly all emails from people we don\'t know contain virus\' right? Then I noticed that after her name came the phrase: Thank You and Package Mailed and the mention of the name Sharon. I backed up my computer to protect all my data before opening the email (not really) and there it was - a reference to my knife. Sharon had given my knife to one of her guests, this woman Corie from New York City, to mail to me upon her arrival back to the US. And sure enough, several days later, the knife arrived at my door step.
Third-pharmaceutical companies in the US subsidize the lower cost of research drugs for the rest of the world-especially those countries with universal coverage. US pharmaceutical companies do all the R&D and FDA approval process-other countires are then allowed to buy from the pharmaceutical companies in bulk-increasing their residents savings. Allow pharmecutical companies a percentage cap of profit for US citizens say 10%-thus forcing them to reap their profits from the other countries around the world. Make other countries subsidize their share of the pharmecutical companies. Once they pay their fair share-they may not be so quick to tout the benefits of universal coverage.
I\'d dare say your not as good with women as you wish you were, you\'re looking for something that can take you above and beyond 99% of men for free, it\'s here, you just have to reach out and grab it
Stan, you say you miss him and didn\'t even know him. Not true. Every day on this site, he shared a piece of himself with you and many others. You knew him well. You are right to be missing your friend.
Lots of things in life don\'t die but instead evolve or get reinvented. Such is the case with this blog. This has been a great blog to write and we have had many dedicated followers over the past one and one half years. But now it\'s time to move on from this blog to... another blog.
Part of the Spanish army came to the Chapala Valley and surrounding area. They were led by Don Alonso de Avalos who arived in 1531 and set up the province of \'Avalos\' which included Tuxpan, Tuzantla, Sayula and Sahuayo. The Spaniards also converted the native peoples to Christianity. Beginning in 1545, a large influx of Spaniards arrived in the area and began to exploit the natural resources of the area. In 1567 the Marquis de Folces turned much of the land into large cattle farms. By the end of the 16th century much of the area was monopolised by the Hacienda de Guaracha.
Also-start a secure transmission database for perscriptions-that way people will not be able to forge signatures or visit tons or doctors to abuse perscription drugs. This would also cut down on potentially harmful drug interactions. Or dosage mistakes due to sloppy handwriting. This will also cut down on the malpractice claims.
How I missed that this time around. I miss his voice. And the new season of TV shows has started. 24 one of our favorites, is back with all cylinders firing. Jack Bauer and the gang had a huge two-night season opener, but there it sat on the TIVO. No Leroy to share it with.
Everyone has their first time and they remember it: the anxiousness, the uncertainty, the wariness, but also the excitement at potential new findings, the rush of adrenaline, the majesty with which you are able to fling yourself into the great unknown.
After we had our filling meal, we headed to a nearby cave, which had a very large opening. The cave was like a theater stage, large enough to accommodate a house inside. We were told that the cave is now considered biologically dead, brought about by the damage done by treasure hunters and the bright lights of the Survivor shoot.
Hai, Sasha here.To me, women was very easier to lose their weigth because everywhere we can saw no men in this world do housework accept forced. women was did the housework and its can be women was very easier to lose thier weigth....Anything you want to commentttt???????
No matter what measuring stick we use, we have all come here and found a place that is our safehouse. We can talk about death, we can talk about treatments, we can laugh, and we certainly know we can cry together.
Finally our dinner was served and we feasted on the local delicacies including grilled fishes. Chatter filled the air with the sound of the sea providing a beautiful background. We met a German woman who was there on her own, embarking on the adventure of solo traveling, and engaged her to talks about the place.
A\'lengthening tally of losses.\'That\'s how Maureen put it into words in her comments to the blog yesterday. She was reacting to the news of Randy\'s death. His name has been a,\'ed to the others who have passed through our community. Some stayed with us in time measured in years, or in Randy\'s case, measured in weeks.
Arriving at noon, we were instantly mesmerized by the rustic garden at its front yard, as well as the sounds of the birds at the mini-aviary. The gravel pathway led us to a an archway of vines and tree branches hanging over the front door of the restaurant, which evoked a mysterious appeal to us. Wood carvings, antique and art pieces, and dolls, caught our roving eyes.

Either way, you should check it out at www.aroundtheworldineasyways.com. Once there, you will discover a blog feature on this site and it is here where I will continue to blog. So come visit my new site and if you have particular ideas of what you would like me to blog about, leave a comment on a blog post or send me an email via Contact the Author. I would love to hear from you.
You should absolutely NOT stop eating. This could result in horrible things that are far worse than getting fat. Just try not eating large portions, not buying so much junk food (or if you live with your parents, tell them not to buy much). Maybe try eating on a diet like the acai berry diet, or even just choosing healthy foods. If you eat a lot of smaller meals throughout the day, and eat very slowly, you\'ll feel full faster. When you feel the temptation to eat in between a \'meal\', drink water. It fills you up, and it\'s very good for your body. But please, don\'t stop eating, you need to eat, your body needs the fats, and sugars for energy. If you stop, your body will start to actually break down your muscles for it\'s nutrients, and you\'ll turn into a living skeleton!! :) I hope I helped you, I really do!!!!!
Finally, we departed the station and took the nearest freeway. Since I got to see little as the bus entered the freeway I dozed off to sleep. I su,\'enly woke up in the mi,\'le of the trip and found myself staring at a beautiful lake surrounded by mountains. The scenic spot was very serene. I was mesmerized that it was too late when I took out my camera. I tried to read any sign that would tell me the name of the place and found a Vista del Lago signage.
Finally, we entered the dining place where a row of Filipino food was set on a table. For less than P400 (less than $10), we availed ourselves of the buffet offering. There was salad, crisp spring rolls, baked clams, beef viand, and chicken viand, among other things.
So, this is California without the skyscrapers and the malls,\' I thought. We passed cities and towns like Wasco, Corcoran, Hanford, Fresno, Madera, Merced, Denair, Modesto, Stockton, Lodi, Elk Grove, Sacramento, Davis, Antioch-Pittsburg, Martinez, and Richmond until we reached Emeryville, which was one station away from the last one   Oakland. The train\'s passengers were also diverse and I felt safe and grateful
I hope someday I\'d be able to come back to CDO, for the nth time, and try the white water rafting adventure. Nevertheless, my first time was always memorable. It made me feel at home in CDO.  That time I was there on my first trip, I didn\'t worry that I wasn\'t able to tour the whole city. I knew in my heart that I would keep coming back to this place after that initial visit. And I would surely visit LimKetKai again and explore more restaurants and do the white water rafting and shop more. The list is endless.
The train ride was smooth. Although there was more room at the second floor, where the dining lounge could be found, I opted to stay in the lower section with Marylou. I later found out that the lower part was reserved for senior citizens and the physically incapable. But there I was with Marylou, and the train conductor checking the tickets didn\'t mind me at all, even when she got off at Hanford.
A small island was discernible from the distance, our destination for that day. For locals and divers, that was Apo Island, known for its rich underwater life.
I have just published a new book about our year long odyssey around the world: Around the World in Easy Ways, A Guide to Planning Long-Term Travel With or Without Your Kids.
Running out the door to go pick my mother up at the airport, I grab a book and bottle of water - it could be a long wait. I find this incredibly great parking space and proceed to the ticket counter in order to get a gate pass; this is my mother\'s first time flying as a blind person and I feel it\'s best if I meet her at the gate. It\'s only been six months since I arrived to this airport from our world travels, but somehow, even in that short period of time, they\'ve managed to rearrange everything. I find security and line up in my cue of five - where is everyone? Isn\'t this the busiest travel time of the year? Why did I leave myself so much time? As the TSA agent scrutinizes my I.D. and gate pass a light bulb goes off in my head, I\'ve got a knife in my purse. I wasn\'t the one traveling, so why should I have remembered to take it out of my bag? I ask the agent if there is any place to leave it for an hour or so until I come back. His lengthy reply of\'No\'leaves me walking back to the car to drop it off. I\'m not losing this knife after finally getting it back from Easter Island!
guys do in fact lose wait faster, guys tend to have a higher metabolism and they are built to be able to gain more muscle than women i mean how many women do you see with an 8-pack let alone a 6-pack?
Last stop was the ship wreck. It wasn\'t buried deep and could be seen from the surface. Some of us circled the ship and found that the corals have claimed most of the ship. It has become a home to many fishes as well, reminding me of a scene in the animation movie, Shark Tale.
The last time I visited CDO, again on a business trip and alone, I took my breakfast in this homey eating place where I also did a little shopping of beautiful household accessories and fashion trinkets. While waiting for my food to be served, I picked out a large native bag and a mat, among other things, paid for it and went back to the adjoining room where my order was invitingly sitting on the table.  The Shrimp Linguine was simply delectable while I sipped the Carrot Citrus shake.  How I loved it!
Mrs. Clinton, I work in health care and see many places where we can improve our system and still provide care for everyone. The first line of care should be the primary care physician (PCP). There are not enough doctors going into primary care to provide adequate care. The PCPs we have are overworked and overbooked. I worked as a case manager in the emergency department of a major trauma center and medical school. We cater to many of our non-funded patients, and the number of ED visits would be greatly reduced if PCPs were available to everyone. If people could get a same day or next day visit, or at least be able to contact their PCP by e-mail.
I instantly liked the mall. Some of the stores were located outdoors and not everything was housed in a giant air-conditioned building. It was modern with a provincial touch that made the ambiance friendlier than the ones we have in the capital. There was an al fresco area, but I think the mall has developed over the years since the first time I was there. I was glad I had that extra time with my friend because the day after, the workshop participants, including colleagues from our national office, started arriving. One of our hosts brought us for dinner at a steak house. The restaurant was dimly lit and cozy with a Western feel, which, for a moment, made me forget that I was in the Philippines. The dinner was sumptuous and we all had our fill.
Women are built for fat storage to be able to survive & care for children during famine. Their essential minimal fat stores are 5x higher than a males. Women were built to accumulate as much fat as possible and to not lose the accumulations for childbirth, milk production & child rearing. Having year around unlimited carbs to create fat are against the natural order.
OMG! No! Some nurse at a hospital gave unethical advice to my grandfather who is diabetic to soak his feet in water and bleach to get rid of athletes feet cracked or dry feet. After a month of listening to this retarded nurse the bleach started soaking in the cracks of his feet and cause it to open more. Later he got an infection and now has half of a foot. Bleach is for cleaning and doing laundry only! Please tell me you haven\'t tried this yet!
We wanted to be at the Taj by dawn the next day. This required us to leave all our belongs in the room until we returned to check out. I just knew that upon our return, anything of any value would be gone. The thought wasn\'t sitting well with me at all. Then I noticed the latch on the outside of the bathroom; ideas began to percolate. I retrieved a pad lock, purchased in Zanzibar, from the bottom of my bag. We placed all four of our suitcases and all four of our backpacks in the bathroom and then placed our pad lock on the outside of the bathroom door. Yes, you\'re picturing this right. We were locking all our belongings in the bathroom. Even if management had a key to the pad lock of our room, they still wouldn\'t be able to get into the bathroom. We left at 6:00 AM for the Taj Mahal feeling a little more at ease.
Sharon emailed me and told me that she would be coming back to the US in the fall for the birth of her grandchild; she would mail the knife to me at that point. But by this time I had lost all hope. It\'s not that I lacked faith in Sharon, it\'s just that I had come to believe that my knife was destined to spend the rest of it\'s existence on Rapa Nui - not a bad fate if I must say so myself.
What she doesn\'t know -- until now, because she reads the blog -- is that she has made this winter bearable for me. That early morning frosty air clears the mind. I\'ve been able to put one foot in front of the other and march down the canal path because she has been by my side and listened to my sorrow spill out in rants and tears and Leroy stories and sometimes all three combined into one long walk. Some days, the hurt has just poured out of me.
With the high noon sun above us, it was time to take our sumptuous lunch at a nearby cottage. I took off my shoes and buried my feet beneath the smooth powdery sand.
Are you going on a trip to a particular place for the first-time? Will you be setting foot in a foreign and unfamiliar soil? This blog site is created for you. I have been to many places, and the first time I stepped into unfamiliar territory I had to feel my way and rely on what I have on-hand especially when all I had were travel books, maps and print-outs from the web. My friends and I make our own itinerary. It is truly advisable to check out anything about the place before going on a trip. Yet, you need not necessarily hire a travel agent or tour guide to get you around every time you visit a place for the first time. A little help from locals can a,\' spice to your first-time travels. It can give you the freedom to explore the place and enjoy the feeling of not spending much, based on my own travel experiences. You can take my word on some tips and information on the places I visited but feel free to be creative and be adventurous. I may offer some advice here and there but, as they say, \'experience is the best teacher\'. So, read on and find out more about my first-time travel adventures.
Sahuayo was affected by the Cristero War of 1926 - 1929. The Cristero War was the most significant relapse to violence and conflict after 1917. It arose from the clergy and traditionalist groups protesting the anti-Catholic policies of the Constitution. The Constitution sought to secularise the country and limit the power of the church. The Constitution prohibited the chucrh from aquiring land, banned monastic orders and church-run schools and forbad any religious activity outside View of the Santuary of Guadalupe of churches (now the property of the government).
Malatapay Beach Resort may be far from the city but it is accessible to the national highway. It has a beautiful location with cottages close to the sea facing Apo Island, a strategic spot to serve as a gateway to the tourist-attractive island. They have several cottages that can accommodate a large group (we were 16 all in all when we went there).
Once our trip was over, I figured our blog was over too. Not that I really wanted it to end (the trip or the blog); it\'s just that in my mind, they went hand in hand. Sure, people will check in to see great safari pictures or to hear about our trials and tribulations on the road, but who is going to check the blog now that we are here back in the US living our normal everyday lives. I guess there are a few people out there who might be interested in hearing about our reentry into\'real\'life, but probably not many.
As we entered Farmerbrown, the place was packed so we had to wait to be seated. I scanned the place and I could tell that the dimly lit restaurant was cozy enough. It has a charm that I couldn\'t describe much in words. Jazz music filled the air that balanced the chatter, which could be heard by the bar where friends and strangers meet up. Near the tall glass window, families were having a reunion of sort. In the mi,\'le and at the other side of the restaurant, the ambiance was a bit subdued, where couples and small groups were enjoying their dinner quietly.
And the young people, lots of them, not all sorority types either; young, fresh and still susceptible to the allure of so much manufactured glamour. Ironically they and their indomitable youth a,\' sauce and substance to the myth. They flesh it out and give it life.
When I got off at Emeryville, I instantly located the bus bound for San Francisco. In less than an hour we were crossing Bay Bridge, passing over Yerba Buena Island and Treasure Island. Alcatraz and the San Francisco city line came into view. We went around San Francisco in six drop off points before we reached the shopping center. I even enjoyed the mini-tour around downtown, the financial district, and the wharf because I got to see other parts of San Francisco that I hadn\'t seen previously. Time passed by so quickly. In a few hours, I was in SFO checking in my luggage. But I was glad that in my short stay in the US, I was able to embark on an Amtrak adventure.
It was a long drive and if we weren\'t careful, we could have missed the small path at our left which leads to Kusina Salud. It would be convenient to go there by private vehicle because the restaurant was a bit secluded.
Besides a couple shots of delicious meals and desserts consumed and neatly arranged market produce encountered during my travels, I rarely take many food photographs, but the next few weeks will find me photographing a variety of raw meats, poultry, and seafood for a new non-travel related client based in Nigeria so I\'m pretty excited about this venture.
Around me courses humanity, in all it\'s incorrigible shapes and forms. I even find people like me, people you\'d never expect to see here in the Vegas of my media fed imagination. To my surprise there is no one particular type dominating here. I see one salon tanned bottle blonde in a tight short black skirt holding a cigarette but next to her, not with her, but sharing her milieu, is a French couple, perfectly Parisian in their understated elegance.
What was even exciting in our Coral Garden snorkeling activity was we saw a tortoise swimming near us. We had to be careful not to scare it away or we might impose some stress level on this marine animal.
We were at the Union Station by 6:30, an hour before the designated schedule. We walked over the counter to show my online reservation. I asked the guy manning the counter if I would have any difficulty with my luggage or if I need to check it in. He took one look at me and my bags (there was a trolley bag, a backpack, and a shoulder bag) and shrugged, \'you\'ll do just fine.\' He also explained that there was one leg in my itinerary wherein checking in my luggage wasn\'t an option, so it would be best if I would just carry them with me. Anyway, there would be baggage compartments where I could deposit my things.
I\'d like to see every citizen of the United States guaranteed basic health care at reasonable prices. We claim to be advanced, enlightened, the best country in the world, and yet our citizens often go without medical care because they can\'t afford it - or can\'t afford the health insurance. The insurance provided through my job is a flat rate regardless of how many people it covers. I am single, no dependents, and yet my insurance premiums cost the same as a co-worker with a family of five. At one point, between jobs, I tried to get independent insurance coverage and was refused because of my weight. I was within their acceptable weight range (which was only 17 pounds higher than the upper\'healthy\'limit for my height), but because I had recently lost 30 pounds they refused me and told me to try again in six months, so they could\'be sure I\'d keep the weight off.\'I\'ve visited insurance companies as part of my previous job. I\'ve seen the 40 acre professionally landscaped site with walking paths and lakes. I\'ve eaten in the executive lunch rooms and employee cafeterias that served better food than most restaurants I\'ve been to. I\'ve seen the three story fountains in the lobby, and I know one company in particular that as a matter of policy closes its doors at noon on Fridays in the summer. When my premiums go to fund the insurance company\'s private fitness club, I have a problem.
And that\'s it, remember these 5 key areas and your golden, you\'ll be miles ahead of 99% of guys out there and finally be able to attract and date that beautiful girl you\'ve been spying on for the past few months.
Now don\'t get me wrong, women don\'t want you to walk up to them and immediately start acting like a sex crazed maniac, but they do want you to open up SOMETIME. Unfortunately most guys never realize this and assume that if they are friendly for long enough something sexual will *just happen*. The truth is it doesn\'t *just happen* unless you make it happen (remember women want to be lead). Usually if you\'ve met a woman out clubbing/through friends and have spent over 20 hours with her and you haven\'t yet kissed, your going to be a friend forever (of course this doesn\'t apply if you work/study with her). Generally it\'s best to start flirting with a girl as soon as you\'re even slightly comfortable around each other (after knowing each others names). This sets the tone of the interaction immediately and lets her know that you are a sexual guy who she could possibly date, not another guy to be placed into the\'just friends\'category.
Should have the gallery up in a few days. Not sure how I\'ll photograph Vienna since the last time I was there, every boring angle of statues, buildings, and museums was duly captured on film. Yes, the property was lavish, attention was paid to every single detail, and the staff was extraordinarily warm so trying to pick apart the hotel and keep digging for negatives when there were clearly no significant misses would be an injustice on my part   personal preferences aside.
well,... wt do i say abt this sweet short gal???!!!! she is a very nice girl basically... very understandin.... always has time for others or rather makes time for friends..... big time brain.... n a true friend... doesnt get angry very fast... n ya typical \'tamilian\',...
So, I\'ve been asking k for a new ring with my birthstone in it ever since my old one got yucky and gave my ring finger a weird looking wrinkle. He has tried all techniques that husbands employ -- agreeing and then pretending that he forgot, plain dilly-dallying, pretending to focus on blank spot with more intensity, changing the topic to li\'l r (This is a good one, I fall for it almost all the time), asking me about myself or my blogs (This one works well too), throwing in random related questions,\'Yeah, you think we should check out the rings in the mall?\'and then,\'What\'s for dinner?\'He is too smart to refuse because he knows the consequences of said refusal but at this point I am weary and annoyed that my delicate ring finger still does not sport a glittering sapphire (or whatever my birth stone is) ring shining with the promised love of our marriage. And so, I tried a different tactic the other night:
Once a software engineer, now a full time mom having fun with my two year old:)I believe in making young children learn through play. Just like we sneak veggies in the food, you sneak something on to the head while playing:)So, this blog is a collection of all the activities me and my son do together. Thanks for stopping by and if you do try some of these with your kids, let me know:)
hy does this happen? Because, men don\'t cry or break down. Instead, the more upset they are, the more they frown or the angrier they appear. Now, we all know women are more attractive than most men. And, nobody feels sorry for an angry man. In fact, the angrier he gets, the uglier he looks, the more despicable he appears. What choice does he have really? If he cries, they\'ll call him sissy. They\'ll say he\'s wuss. And it\'s not really macho. So he does what he has to. Pretend he\'s got buffalo-skin.
Wow. Deep breath. I have so much to tell you, evidently. Today we went for Sunday lunch at the Polo Club, owned by the drummer for The Who, and THEN, Ronnie Wood walked in. (I\'ll give you a minute. Did you hear crickets? I did.) Ronnie Wood is one of the guitarists for The Rolling Stones and okay, so it wasn\'t Mick Jagger, but it was still quite exciting. JC\'s mother pointed him out to us, with his very young girlfriend and do you mind if I segue into a little rant about the English girls I\'ve been seeing with very bare legs and shoulders and how I look at them with horror and envy, half wanting to be them, confident that it isn\'t really thaaaaaaaaaaaat cold, or be that age again, when vanity took precendence over comfort.
Don\'t know why I am writing this.. but I feel like writing this...why is that everytime i read a post here, i am relating it with a page in my life? why is that every time, i m reminded of my dad or mom when i read anything out here.. reason- all of us- we go through same phases in life.. emotions are the same!  bt the bizziare thing abt this post is tht- i have never had much friends too.. i was, guess all the time, in my own world.. at school- nt many kids used to talk to me- coz i always used to in these music or drama kind of activities.. for some reason other kids found tht to be some kind of strange thing.. i was an alien species among the\'mark/grade hungry\'crowd... it became the opposite while at college! so, i have never had much people whom i could call friends..

So many times in life mom had come across groups of individuals who would come and advise her on how to do things. Then another will say whatever she had been doing would be wrong and that she has to start over. At different points in time in life. Now there are people that tell me that I should not be on this blogging/tweeting scene and that there should be more exclusivity. And that a musician needs to maintain the distance. Sometimes I feel that they are right. Considering some comments I get, I wonder why people are so obsessed with obscenities and the related but why should I be subject to all this is their question. Yes it does make sense several times. But if and when I don\'t blog, it would perhaps be because I have tired of this medium of expression and there would be a proper goodbye. I don\'t see it happening for now but the thing is, no matter what you do, there will be tons of free advice. And in Oscar Wilde\'s words\'I alwayspass on good advice. It\'s the only thing to do with it. It is never any use to oneself.\' 
CSI has provided us with bad debt collections since January of 2005.    We are very pleased with the results that CSI has given us. Our accounts are transferred to them electronically, and we receive monthly payments and reports from them.    We have never had a patient complaint about about their treatment from CSI. The only complaints we have found are usually pertaining to billing insurance/co-pay issues. They understand healthcare receivables and we have a most satisfactory relationship with them. I would highly recommend CSI to any healthcare organization.

The couple decided to get married at court and have a day long party after that. We met Small and Mr Small (who really deserves his own name here, but I can\'t think of one at the moment, so Mr. Small it is) at one of London\'s oldest pubs, The Prospect Of Whitby. So old that it even has its own Wikipedia page! Coolness. The pub was delightful, we had the upstairs \'Pepys Room\' all to ourselves, a we,\'ing party of about twenty people, foreigners and Indians and it overlooked the Thames. Interestingly, the room we were in was once used for cock fighting and boxing matches, which made me think of Sherlock Holmes , which in turn made me think of Robert Downey Jr with his shirt off. Good times.
hehehehhhhuhuhhuuhhahhahahhhaa oh shit! hehhehahahhhahhahahah chuck it! hhohhhohohhahahahahhahaahhah. thts rad for u. my substitute sis in atlanta :) rad is a fun loving devil child who can laugh till her insides explode. thats a good thing though coz the jokes she cracks can seem funny to none but her!!

Firstly, I congratulate you on winning the prestigious Booker prize. It is a remarkable achievement indeed for a young first-time novelist.  I started reading \'White tiger\' but was straight away baffled by a work in English that begins, \'Neither I nor you speak any English, but there are some things that can only be said in English\'. Why would a major work in the English language adopt the epistolatory voice of someone who does not know the language and be a,\'ressed to someone else who does not know both English and the language spoken by the letter writer, I wondered. But, that is not why I am writing to you.   I have read much about how you came to write this book. You have been quoted as saying,\' So, where\'s this Shining India everyone\'s talking about? It was time someone broke the myth,\'and that \'The world needed to see the other side of India.
It makes me uncomfortable when people talk across cubicles in restrooms. I don\'t know if men do this as well. I know some women at my office who are\'restroom bu,\'ies\'. They enter the restrooms chatting away about something and continue their conversations from the stalls as they do their business. No matter that they might not even be in adjacent stalls! For someone caught in the crossfire of this talk, it is totally awkward. Can\'t they wait until after they\'ve left the restrooms to talk?
ur my honey bunch ,sugar plum, cuppy yuppy pumpkin, ur my sweetie pie ur my cuppy cake gumdrops , smikibikimi,the apple of my eye and i love you so , and i want you to know, that ill always be right here , and i love to sing this song to you, because you are my baby bear:D
THE CHATTERBOX, i would call her, she keeps talking throughout (interesting though) i spend my entire time in the college bus every morning, listening to music sharing a single earfone.. she is really, friendly, helpful and understanding. she helps u out even before u approach her. a great friend indeed!
hmmm.. am one extremely sensitive gal who\'s over possesive bout my frenz.. i hate solitude.. always need to be pampered n cared for.. \'m one music freak.. i can listen to music continuously 24*7... \'m a srtict vegetarian n cant stand ppl eatin non veg..used to b reserved but now a talkin freak.. tats it bout mi!!!
It is a quiet Friday morning. Sitting by the window in his bedroom, Sankaran watches the street bustling with activity. Men hurrying to work, children walking to school, and women, busy with their daily chores   some sending off their husbands and children, a few rushing to work themselves, some getting back from the temple. He also sees the old men and women warming up their feet for the day. Even as the world goes on with its life at a hectic pace, Sankaran has very little to do, at least that morning.
This is Sandra ;;I have been doing business with Collection Services, Inc. for more than 30 years and they have delivered top quality service to all my clients.    All of our contact with CSI is handled in a very professional manner.  One of the things we enjoy most about using CSI as a collection vendor is that we do not receive consumer complaints about their method of collecting.    CSI is efficient in their collections and they give us outstanding service. We look forward to many more years of using them as a vendor.    I highly recommend CSI for bad debt collection.

That\'s how r~ says\'Happy\'when the\'Happy Birthday\'song plays on TV. When I turned 30, I acted like the typical drama queen -- resisting, reminiscing, wondering how this chunk of my life would turn out. But the big three-oh turned out to be fine mostly and in a,\'ition to a little love bundle in my arms, I managed to get a book out there. Check, check (as Monica would say). And now, I am at that crossroads again wondering what this year will bring. A published novel would be nice. It would be reaaallly nice. And then I would be one of those cool moms who could claim that they took care of their baby while working from home on something they were passionate about. But, I am not that mom now. I am just a mom who is turning a year older who is dreaming big dreams while her little one continues to throw delightful little challenges her way and melt her heart with her love (I could talk a lot more about r~ but I\'ll reserve that for my secret mommy blog ;)
Hi suriya, Really happy to have a frnd like u. Very cool, always smiling, charming girl. I like ur way of talking. u became close with me very soon. I luv u dear
Steffi is my chweet n darling sis. she is cute , loving n soooo very adorable!...a chatter box who always eats my head. I really miss her now that am not at home! I guess not every person in this world is blessed to have a sister like her. She is some one I look upto! Though she fights with me a lot (in which I win most of de times), she is the best ..very helpful and kind in nature has always helped me with my studies. A mega brain, not nice to have her as a senior in school (with teachers all de time praising blah..blah) Thank God I got rid of her now (just joking!!) She is crazy of books and luvs 2 eat junk food all de time. sheës got a lovely hair which I am very jealous of! Indeed she is a book worm. She is a pink gal .looooooooves pink rite frm her pens n wallets to her ipod, everything is pink! Thank God she hasn\'t seen a pink car yet she is a real ki,\'o she still has a craze for Barbie dolls OMG!  STEFFI I LUV U. U R THE BEST GIFT GOD HAS EVER GIVEN ME!!!

There are a few things which characterise my friendship with Anoosha - 1) We simply have to fight every week. If at all we miss one week, we\'ll have an extra ferocious fight to compensate . This constitutes the most important part of our bonding  2) We also have to have a mutual ego boosting session, where we compliment each other( coz noone else seems to do so) 3) We have to text each other everyday, even the most inane details of what we\'re doing-\'I\'m in the bus\',\'I\'m in the train\',\'I\'m bored\',\'So am I\'etc. If this doesn\'t happen on a day to day basis, read point (1). Dishoom dishoom Probably the best thing about my friendship with her is that I don\'t have to pretend..I can straight away say to her face what I think of her, and she returns the favour too :) I personally feel that no relationship/friendship is ever complete without a fight, because you require that intimacy even to fight..That said, I\'m gonna miss our weekly fights when this idiot runs away to do her MS. Love U!
hmmm..charanya or charanga..watever u call her..she is d first lady of our class n dept..she is one person who ll have somethin to tell u 24 hrs a day all days a week..classes r never borin (how much ever the profs try makin thm borin) if u r next to her..she was the padips of our class but now out all that nonsense..she always has a reason for watever she tells though the reasons r mostly(nope always;) ) insane!!! she has been a carin,sweet n very entertainin..life rocks wit u pal :)..
charangs..i find it hard to put down in words(that too a max of 1024 chars) about this wonderful person who happens to be one of my close friends..we\'ve had loads of fun in coll,most of the times at her expense..shes one person i can talk to bout anything under the sun..heres to u..my friend, my confidant..as cliched as it sounds,im sure our friend\'ship\' will never sink or stink!
Listless eyes fixed aimlessly on the road. The dry hum of the AC blowing on my face. One long never ending road. The slow monotony of a highway drive. Many kilometres covered. Mindless music crooning in the background. Every mile seemed to me like the road was gobbling up human beings, villages and vehicles alike. The road swallowing the people and things that it passed by in seconds. The car swallowing the road as it moved ahead. The vicious cycle kept replaying before my eyes and su,\'enly brought a memory to the forefront . A memory that tore its way from that place , deep inside mind, where it was locked away for eternity. The loud screaming thoughts rudely shook my reprieve and replaced the stoic silence of my mind.

okie arch felt a lot that i dint write much in her slam book .. so making it up 2 u this way .. wat to tell about this sweet samathu angel faced gal ( i mean it really u know ) well lots because as the saying goes appearences are deceptive . The only one in the A gang who holds the record for never getting caught in class inspite of sitting next 2 shah .. what she does , well i doubt if she knows herself . to talk archa\'s trademarks , bad bad handwriting , few salwars that atleast one other person will own , some so different that they can give ksh\'s designer wear a run , matching earrings to give appu competition. Very tolerant person ( after all she tolerated the THIRD one for many sems and had nightmares resulting from it ) . No one can beat her in word racer , though i doubt her counter strike abilities . Snoopy like nancy drew which provide good base material for gossip .. her luck ( well i would rather not remind her of it ) .. wat els movie buff book-a-maniac and pakki of first order
Pre-r (which is how I am going to call my pre-parent days), I used to notice one common characteristic among parents. Whenever they had their baby with them, they would try to convince the baby to do something fascinating like saying the alphabets or singing a song or even dancing a particular piece. It almost never worked. The kid would look shy and hide behind the parent or would just look blank and do nothing. I would excitedly wait for the kid to do its wonder but couldn\'t help wondering what made the parents want so desperately for the kid to perform. I believed them, that the kid can say its alphabets or sing a little jingle or tap dance; then why the attempts to coerce the unwilling kid to do that?
Its like yesterday, but I can still remember the day i first met you.It was August 19,2005 around noon.We were all gathered for the first year\'s orientation day.At first sight itself you waved at me like a very old friend and introduced yourself to me and i was amazed.This is how it all started. I never thought i would be really this close to you as you had many friends in college. But you took the initiative and made sure that I was comfortable with you. Sumi can read your mind just like that. A very true and a loyal friend to have. She is unpredictable at certain times. Dont try to mess up with her feelings. Just accept the way she is and you will be really surprised to see a very different person altogether. She can be silly and intelligent at the same time. I wonder how she can watch a movie all night and still manages an 80 in the next day\'s test. She makes a boring class very lively by her constant doubts. Hey SUMI you are the best i have ever had.I will do my best to make you feel the same way!..

Maha is a bundle of energy. Loves to have fun, enjoys life to the fullest and then of course - lives for the present (pun intended ;-). Down to earth, believes in a heap load of her own\'principles\'!!! Good sense of humour and a shweeet smile. It definitely pays to be in her good books :-))) And who better to write this testimonial than me - her anbu thangatchi !! Aint I lucky ?!? Cos Manjuu..u r simply the best.
There are serials, mindless game shows, cloying\'reality\'dance shows, movies, movies and more movies. They debuted\'Adaverallam Aada varalaam\'recently. The preview shows this guy who injures himself on the dance floor. Prithviraj (aka Babloo) is begging the show\'s judges to let him be taken to the hospital. Huh?! The injured guy comes up with a really stupid line like,\'All warriors want to fall on the battlefield. I\'d rather die on stage than go to the hospital.\'Second huh?!!!!!!! Okay, drama queen, if you want to die on-stage, that\'s your problem. But we don\'t want to see it.  Of course, its all coached\'reality TV\'lines. Still, who comes up with such crap at Sun TV?

This week in home video, we\'ve got a slew of brand new releases coming your way. Unfortunately, only a few of them were critical darlings, but the ones that are critic-approved are pretty good ones. Among the new releases are the latest in Stephenie Meyer\'s Twilight series, the most recent offering from Disney\'s traditional animation department, a couple of action flicks that didn\'t perform as well as they would have liked, a computer animated update of an anime classic, director Pedro Almodovar\'s latest film, and a boxset of a brutal South Korean trilogy. Dig in, and hopefully there\'ll be something worth your while this week!
Regular readers of this blog, and I am happy to say that it as many as five people, have been pointing out that it has remained unupdated for over two months. A very devoted reader, horror of horrors, even threatened blogultery, if I did not come up with a post soon. I know how hard I have toiled to build readership to such impressive levels and I feel terrified at the prospect of losing it all.  I do have a good reason for not blogging. I was away on a holiday for three weeks and while I did contemplate writing about it, I decided against doing so. What, I felt, could I possibly say about London that hasn\'t already been said? After all, the very wonderful city attracts an impressive 30 million tourists every year.
XPU Ha Don¥t worry be happy from David Furchtgott on Vimeo . As we were driving into our house, I was listening, to the song\'Don¥t Worry , be Happy\', and, It is unbelievable, to think back, and to see how much we have achieved out of a dream... we started of a tree in Xpu Ha, just sitting down with a kite waiting for the wind, planning to have a Sabatical season... and look where we are now... Thank you very much for the support! I¥m looking forward to see what is next! Keep it Real, Keep it Morph! Thank you Ben, for taking the time to shoot this pictures and also edit them in your holidays! very nice!, he was taking this pictures side by side with Chantelle, he was\'embarrased\'to give me this pictures, because he says that he can not compete with Chantelle¥s session, however, I told him, that every photographer has a pint of view, also that he doesn¥t have the big monster camera as Chantelle does, but his pictures are awesome as well, and every picture is different, every eye is deifferent, so Ido appreciate a lot your pics Ben! when I took him a picture to post in the blog, he says : don¥t take a picture of e I¥m going to be horrible in that picture..... I took the picture of him and when he saw it, he told me: you see? JUST LIKE I TOLD YOU....HORRIBLE!!! JAJAJA! anyway MOn Ami, Merci Beaucoup!!! saludos! este dia nos soplÛ bastante bien, el viento, estaba m·s o menos como 15 nudos de direcciÛn Noreste, Yanick, empezÛ a armar su EH Beast V3, de 6 m2, mientras yo le ayudaba a estirar sus l\'neas. esto fue en la escuela de kitesurfing de Morph en la playa de Xpu Ha, Yanick vino con varios de sus amigos de Cancun, pero Èl fuÈ el ˙nico que continuÛ con su entrenamiento. hoy seguimos con el trainer, y Yanick ya tiene much\'simo control con su papalote! ahora ya est· dando giros, vueltas, kiteloops! etc, al final de la tarde nos terminamos la arrachera, y fuÈ un buen final de dia en Xpu ha... AndrÈs, fuÈ el fotÛgrafo de Èste dia. thank you very much por las fotos Amigo! and also thank you for the Tacos de Carnitas! that was a nice experience! saludos! Buenas Tardes David, I trust you are well and business is growing! It was great meeting you on the beach in January. I had a lot of fun photographing you kiteboarding and listening to your passionate words about your sport. You\'re setting a powerful example. I would have liked to have accepted your invitation for lessons before leaving on our journey to weave together the prophecies of the Maya and Inka at the sacred sites of Tulum, Coba, Chichen Itza, and Ek Balam. I didn\'t have the space to stop by this time and will build room into my schedule when I return. It was pretty different, almost difficult, coming back to Sweden with a temperature of -20 C compared to the +28 C in Tulum. Three journeys to Tulum in the last 15 months and looking forward to returning as soon as possible. You have a beautiful country and the land speaks to me. It would be cool to meet up with some kiteboarding folks here in Stockholm. I appreciate any connections you may have. Thank you. As agreed David, here are some of the photos that I took that afternoon. They are small at 72dpi to keep the email size low. Left me know if you would like any in a larger size. I join ed Morph Kiteboarding group on FB when I saw it the other day. Warm regards, Scott as I¥m coming out of the Xpu Ha Palapa, I see Francoise, writting something, as I approach I can spy that he is studying the wind window! good for you man! I love to see people thirsty for knowledge! I actually don¥t even think he knows I took his picture.. saludos ! Nokia Morph Concept from Ozan Basar on Vimeo . Read more about... Cia Cucoritza! thank you Zolt·n for this amazing set!
Post note: Little bunny died about three hours after I brought him in house. I\'m sure the stress was just too much for him. He seemed to be picking up some speed at one point. It is all for the better. He was warm and cared for. I found a wounded bunny near a hay pile I was moving by the lamb stalls this morning. He had tucked himself into the safest spot he could, and squeaked when I was near by. His hind leg has a puncture wound, through to the bone. He\'s alive, but I\'ve had my Dr. Quinn episodes with bunnies, wildlife doesn\'t fare well with human interference even when well intended. I imagine a cat got him. I iodined it after saline bath. He is more alert than when I found him, and I have him at my desk safe from puppies and wandering felines. Not sure if he will make it. He\'ll die attended though, although the sounds of the dogs playing is probably not helping. He is calm when held. The wandering array of life continues, as does pending death. These little episodes are not meant to distress, but to remind us of the bigger picture. Life is temporary, and can be snapped away in a bite by man or beast. The conflict of having compassion for but raising livestock to sustain me, the conflict of helping a bunny that eats my food...intertwined. Lilly had her lambs last night. She finally started labor around six p.m. and we came to the barn a few times to find her still in pre labor. This early morning we arrived to find lambs, two beauties. The male is very large, and already eating a little grass this usually doesn\'t happen for a few days or more.] The girl is this wonderful strawberry blonde. Sadly, on my second trip to the barn, she had torn her eyelid on a piece of the lambing pen - I treated with saline and antibiotic and think it will heal fine. Lilly is one of our work horse sheep - always calm, and stoic. She\'s a big girl who throws strong lambs. I was concerned she had held out this long, as we never have lambs past 3/12...and of course my over active imagination drummed up all sorts of possibilities. I tortured myself by re-reading my sheep books about possible causes, and lay in bed last night with visions of Lilly lying in breach birth trauma...but I guess Mlle. Nature just wasn\'t ready to pop those two out, and they arrived very mature - with ears already standing by morning. Normally I wait at least one day to put mom and lambs out, but it\'s sunny and warm, and Lilly is an old pro. It\'s less stressful than being separated from the flock. They develop so much faster - I find - when they can go outside. I want to thank all the nice thoughts people held for us this season- I have to say, I feel like a boulder has been lifted off my chest. The trauma of last year really made a mark on me, and Martyn, and it showed this season. We lost the stillborn girl, and I still fret about the surviving twin\'s rattle, but all in all, we are pleased. And relieved. As the last ewe to lamb, Lilly rests, and waits. And one of Audrey\'s boys catches some sunny zzzzz\'s. On what most likely was a chilly March 10th in 1958, in a hospital room at St. Mary\'s in Rochester, Minnesota, I came bolting into the world at precisely 10:18 PM. And so begins the story which over the years has reached mythical proportions- how I almost killed my mother on my birthday. Perhaps it is one reason I chose to never have children - my own mother terrified the heck out of me with my own birth story. In all seriousness, my mother did almost bleed to death, and I have this scar she likes to point out on my forehead from the momentous occasion. Supposedly my father looked pale and upset when he saw me because I was pink and red and lobster like, where as my brother came out a year earlier looking like JFK - seriously, for years my mother compared my brother\'s looks to JFK. I was compared to a lobster. And hours before I barged out of the womb, my father had been called to the morgue, where his 57 year old mother lay dead, of a heart attack, diabetes related. Her untimely death led me to receive her name, Katherine, instead of Bridgette which my mother had picked out. I cant imagine being named Bridgette, although as a child I liked to tell this story, since Bridgette Bardot was all the rage, and as a chubby little redhead, I thought BB was quite the cat\'s pajamas. So I can only imagine the yin and yang and surreal quality of that cold March night for my father. I wonder if there were things that brought it all back to him as he aged. Did the sound of heels on a linoleum floor late at night bring back a sensation of the events he dealt with that night? As I get older, 52 years older to be exact, I can understand how this moment is burned into my mother, or father, in some kind of post traumatic stress way. But being true Minnesotans, we carried on, and every year, my mother made me one of my favorite layer cakes- at the time it was white cake with pink butter frosting. In time, my tastes changed to German chocolate, or her white cake with chocolate frosting. I still have the same recipe cards she hand wrote so many years ago, all spotted with vanilla stains. While I appreciate that I was born, I am not one of the people out there saying that birth is beautiful. In fact, I couldn\'t disagree more. It\'s an intimate moment of a mother creature being out of control of her body. Miraculous, yes, but not beautiful. I get just about as much birth as I need on the farm, thank you very much , and all the blood, after birth and vaginal prolapses that come with it. I think birth is traumatic, terrifying, bloody and completely chaotic. It\'s a mess. In fact, it makes no sense. A creature pushed out of a keyhole - that\'s not beautiful, it\'s bizarre. It\'s a miracle, but it\'s not beautiful. But it\'s the only way to get a foot in the door, isn\'t it? Staying in a womb all your life would be safe, and warm, and inexpensive - no taxes, no maniacs on the radio shouting at you. But there would be no grand entrance, no kisses, no pie made with the first strawberries, no front row seats to Neil Young. No puppies. No showers on a hot day. No hand to hold when a father dies and no little mouths to feed when a mother dies. No matter what creatures come into your life, mothering is the beautiful part of birth. That some one would go through that trauma to give another creature a way to get their foot in the door of this big, messy place called life. The winds have come in, it\'s bone chilling. All day I was carried back to a place I liked to hide when I was little, a grove of sumac bushes out behind our house. Alone, I felt protected, but spooked at the same time. Rushing back to the house, I\'d hear the wind blowing buckets and roof tops, and it felt scary like the Wizard of Oz. But home was warm, there was homemade cake even on my non birthday. It wasn\'t messy. It\'s like that today - the sounds of the barn roof rattling in the wind are spooky, but I feel safe in the barn, surrounded by my mothering ewes. Together with my flock, I experienced the trauma of last year\'s lambing, and just like my mother did after my birth, I carry that trauma with me in a little surface wound, in danger of getting reopened if I bump it just right. I realized it\'s my very own birth story, and it\'s required if one expects to find a sense of place in this messy world. March 10, Post Note: Daisy presented my with two healthy lambs this morning, a perfect way to start my birthday. They\'ve made it 8 hours...we\'ll hope they do well tonight. They appear okay. I saw some tail wiggling while at the u,\'er [ asign they are getting milk]. When I saw these pictures, I was quite amused at their expressions. Amazing how they adapt. We are grateful for the sun and warmer weather, to help our lambing week along. These are Fern\'s lambs, now one week old. We had hoped more of the girls would lamb this weekend - perfect weather. I knew everyone of the 5 ewes was ready to pop, but I like to keep them up and atom until they really go down into labor. The new mothers can surprise you though - I once had a new mom wa,\'ling casually back to the barn with her baby half way out. So last night I was pretty sure Nelly Moser would lamb. And she did. I have been somewhat concerned about what type of mother Nelly would be- of all our sheep she is somewhat flighty. Arriving at the barn, there she was with two fresh lambs, probably born around 8 am. But she wasn\'t caring to them very proficiently- she wasn\'t licking them or chortling much. One was quite dopey looking and chilled, not a good sign. I checked her u,\'er and she had milk, and both ram lambs did suck on my finger, another good sign. I opted not to tube them [a procedure where you insert a stomach tube and force feed], and gave him milk from my finger instead. I decided to take them outside since it is sunny and much warmer outside than the cool barn. Nelly was just a bit clueless, but she\'s adapting. She is chortling more, and can get them to the u,\'er, but she\'s not as good as the pros at helping them \'get it\'. She did not dry them off well either, and I had to step in and help. Within a half hour, I had them warmed up, thanks to the towel and the sun. We will just have to watch them and see. In the last 3 hours, I think both mother and lambs are adjusting to the newness of everything. And the other girls wait...here\'s Lilly, who I\'m sure will go soon. In fact, they are all showing signs of pending labor. The rules of this game are simple: wait...watch...then run with all your heart to where ever the guy in front of you runs.
Great track workout! 3/4 mile slow jog, a bunch of drills (high knees, lunges, killer long jump things, etc.) Then we did a mile on the track, sprinting on the straight parts &amp; walking on the curves. Invigorating! Then a 1/4 mile cool down jog. Then one of the other girls and I did a mile jog--really nice way to wrap up an early morning workout! (Kind of stinks that w/the time change, the whole 5:45-6:45 workout was in the dark.) It still AMAZES me that, at the end of the workout, I can do a mile slow jog and talk the whole way through. I mean, my heart rate is still going up, and my lungs get a workout, but it\'s pretty easy. That\'s just crazy. And awesome. Total was 3 miles plus the drills. We were out there about an hour. 3.27 miles, 36 minutes, 11:00 pace. Okay, it wasn\'t a good pace, but boy was it a GREAT run. I focused on going slow, and was able to think more about lengthening my stride. I a,\'ed a little speed at the end, but if I hadn\'t done that, I felt like I could have run for at least 10 more minutes. Maybe my easiest run ever. But still a good workout. I\'m liking this slow jogging thing. :) Wow! Not the greatest energy today, but a great run! This is the furthest I\'ve ever run, but just a bit (both time & distance.) I\'m pleased that I focused on conserving my energy but was still a little faster than Thursday (even though speed isn\'t the goal right now.) Next week when I a,\' 4 more minutes to my run I should be up over 3.5 miles. :) 3.39 miles, 36 minutes, 10:37/mile 3.03 miles in 33 minutes (10:52 per mile.) For my 10K training I\'m focusing on SLOWING my pace so that I can run a bit longer each week and build up my endurance! This felt like a great, fairly easy pace for me. I was able to speed up just a bit in the last half mile, and I sprinted for the last 45 seconds. Knowing I had that extra energy at the end, I know I could have gone further. 6.2 miles seems a lot more attainable when I\'m not pushing my speed! The trainer doing our Tuesday track sessions gave me advice on how to train for my April 4 10K. Here\'s the plan: Week 1 (this week): Track training 33 minute run 2-36 minute runs Week 2: Track training 36 minute run 2-40 minute runs Week 3: Track training 40 minute run 2-44 minute runs Week 4: Track training 44 minute run 2-48 to 49 minute runs So the idea is to increase my distance by 10% per week, and to run the whole way, no matter how slow I need to go. That way I\'ve got the endurance to run most and maybe even all of the 10K. Running the whole way would be amazing but I\'m not putting too much pressure on myself. That would be about 20 minutes longer than my longest training run. We\'ll see how much energy, motivation, and adrenaline I have on race day! Right now I think a reasonable goal for the 10K is 68:12 or less. That\'s an average of 11 minutes or less per mile. As I get closer, I\'ll reevaluate to determine if that still seems like a good goal or not. I\'m starting weekly group track workouts with a trainer to help my running. Today we did a slow warm-up jog (3/4 mile), then did a timed mile. One mile time was 8:58! Personal best! I am thrilled to have run a mile in under 9 minutes! This was my first official 5K! My pace was just a smidge slower than last time I ran in my neighborhood. I think with the excitement I got off on my breathing, and I did a little bit of walking near the end because of some side cramps and just being winded. But it went great, and I can\'t wait to beat this time next time I do a race! Out of 181 women, I was #91, which puts me precisely in the mi,\'le of the pack. I\'m pretty happy with that, with under 4 1/2 months of running under my belt Honestly, I was hoping to have my personal best time/pace, but it was still a really great experience. More interval training! Used one of Skip Orem\'s GetFitPod podcasts again. Man, it\'s HARD! My\'sprints\'are not very fast at the end! But I know it\'ll help my speed in the long run, and I enjoy the challenge. I heartily recommend these podcasts. Woo hoo--cut 48 seconds of my previous best 5K time!! Wow, that\'s getting very close to my 10 minute per mile goal! Tomorrow I\'ll do some interval training, then Sunday is my first official 5K. Hoping the adrenaline gets me down to my goal! 3.13 miles in 31:33, 10:04/mile
We did some more ringing in the garden this morning. When Derek arrived it was raining steadily and we didn\'t think we\'d be able to get any nets up at all. After a cup of coffee, things brightened up and we put up one 40\' net.We stood in the kitchen and watched birds flying over, under and round the side of the net. It was pretty dispiriting! Eventually we caught two Blue Tits and a Great Tit simultaneously, and then it got windy. So things weren\'t looking too good.Fortunately, despite the wind and occasional drizzle, we did OK.We caught two Reed Buntings (we\'ve had as many as 15 in the garden at the same time this week), which was pretty good. This one\'s a male. The pale flecks on his head will soon wear away, revealing smart, plain black feathers underneath.For a while it looked likely that the Reed Buntings would be the highlight of the morning. Then we caught this bird:A Great Tit, you say. Not very interesting, surely. Well, the thing about this Great Tit is that it already had a ring, and it wasn\'t one that we\'d put on. So it\'s come from somewhere else. In itself, that\'s interesting enough (we\'ll have to wait to find out where it was ringed).The extra-interesting thing was that the ring was a size larger than normal - a B ring (AAs are the smallest, for things like Goldcrests and Willow Warblers, then As, and Bs are usually for birds like Greenfinches).When young Great Tits are ringed in the nest as chicks (or pulli&nbsp;as ringers like to refer to them), they need the next ring size up. This is because their legs are actually fatter while they\'re developing!The ring still fits OK now that the bird is a thinner-legged adult, but hopefully the person who ringed it will be really pleased to hear that one of their pulli&nbsp;has made it to adulthood. The reason that Great Tits have such huge families (up to 9 eggs) is because many of them - 62% on average - will die in their first year.
I remember years ago before I had a blackerry, before I knew anything about having this type of instant access to the worldwide web, to e-mails, to google, to bbm, I would look at my friends who would use their phones for anything else other than to make and receive phone calls or to send the occasional text as crazy or bored or lame or\'too cool for school\'so to speak. And don\'t let me get started on those who would do all this stuff while they were driving. Those people were REALLY crazy!!Fast forward to a couple years ago and the acquisition of my own blackberry and I became/have become that person I so chastized. It\'s one thing to put one\'s phone to full use and by that I mean, go ahead have fun, use all the apps and gadgets on there but the thing I had come to dislike about my own phone usage was that I had become a culprit of doing these things while I was driving.The thing is I know better!! I\'ve seen all the stories about the accidents that people have gotten into, the deaths that have been caused, that could\'ve been avoided had that person not been fooling around with their phone. I\'ve seen the mothers crying on Dr. Phil and I\'ve seen the anguish that this basically self-serving, selfish act has wrought on the lives of so many. Yet I, like so many others, just convinced myself that I was actually good at it. That it was just those people who didn\'t know how to text, bbm, google and drive.Studies have shown that it is equally, if not more dangerous to do these things while driving than it is to drive drunk!! And that still didn\'t stop me. But something hit me, quite literally, when a friend of mine who drives and text
I was sorting through some papers I need to file away and I came across this picture I cut out of a gardening magazine. I may have shown you this one before. I think it is a gorgeous combination. As I admired it all over again, I realized that I had just ordered one of those big black elephant ears! Whoo hooo....I am going to create a look alike of this planter. I even have a container in a similar blue color. This one.... I think it will work, though it\'s a bit smaller than I would like. Now I just need to find some Hakone grass (Hakonechloa macra \'All Gold\'). I think I saw it for sale around here last year. Of course that does not mean I will find it now that I want it. I often buy a plant and the next year it\'s no where to be found. I guess I could use any plant with grass-like foliage in a chartreuse color...of course, I can\'t think of any other..........can you? I am really beginning to get excited for planting time! For the past two years I have been wanting a black (really it\'s dark purple) elephant ear plant. I could not find one any place in my town. So when I got Breck\'s offer today, I immediately ordered this collection: I will get one each of the following varieties: Hilo Beauty - heart-shaped leaves in a unique camouflaged pattern Black Magic - mysterious dark purple foliage up to 2 feet in length Persian Palm - serrated leaves up to 42 inches long pointing outward As an a,\'ed bonus, they include a free Polly Elephant Ears. They are small; just 18inches or so high. I already have one of these in a combination planter I bought last year and keep inside. I did not know what it was until today. Elephant ears go quite nicely with my other tropicals -- cannas and calla lilies. If I spent $50, I got $25 off, so I also ordered another Rembrandt Dahlia collection. It was basically free - just tax and shipping. I really enjoyed the splotchy paint-like splatters on the ones I got two years ago. So now I am gung-ho on planting the deck containters. It\'s still two months away for me, but it will go by fast. I probably won\'t be buying any annuals again this year because I won\'t have room for any. Anybody else ordering flower bulbs, corms, etc? I have had my eye on this vivid flower pin for some time. I think it\'s cute as a bug\'s ear, as they say down south. It\'s 3.5 x 4 inches across. It\'s made to pin to a jacket or sweater and wear like a brooch. But that is not what I plan to do with it. My thought is to affix it to a big hair barrette and wear it with some of my bright spring jackets when I pull my hair into a short, stubby ponytail. I think it will go with that bright star handbag I made a few weeks ago. This one... Whoa......they will see me coming for a mile in all directions! If I like it, I will make a bunch more of them. It looks like it\'s pretty easy to make. My plan is to use denim and matching fabrics for the bags I\'ve made. And if I don\'t like it.....well, it was on clearance for only $4.99, so I won\'t be out much. Thank you all for the kind comments on my last post! I am finding it very rewarding to make bags to match individual outfits. I have not actually used any yet, but they are fun to design and sew. They are not the kind of bags I would take to work, but I think I will have a ball using them for my leisure activities this spring/summer. I was surprised to see a comment from my Mom asking for a bag. Yes, Mother, I would be happy to make you a handbag. Just let me know which color tulip you would like. I can be your personal handbag designer---Look out Louis Vuitton -- Zoey bags may soon be all the rage! Since I am answering questions in this post, I shall answer one more: Yes, Dianne, that umbrella seems to be full size. If anyone makes one of these, please let me know. I would love to see what yours looks like! Of course, if I do make one, I will let you know how it turned out. I ordered a safari print jacket this week. It has not arrived yet, but I printed its picture and began searching my stash to see what I could find to make a coordinating handbag. I found all of this stuff that I think will work--animal print fabric, leather, black bead trim and even a black boa! I just might run that around the top of the bag. I even have handles that are perfect - black and bronze beads. So far I have only been looking for items to use -- I have not even begun to make the bag. I\'m still in the mental designing mode. I probably should wait until the jacket arrives before going further. Sometimes the colors are quite different when I get the jacket than they looked on my monitor . So far this week I have made two bags and have all the materials to make #3 and I have not had to go out and buy a single thing! I love using up my stashed items--especially all those handles I bought last fall when Joanne\'s had a 50% off sale. I have almost used them all up. I hope they have another sale soon! Is this not the cutest, most creative use of an umbrella you\'ve ever seen? It was in this month\'s issue of Midwest Living along with this watering can creation. I think they are both simply adorable and I will probably be making them soon. In the meantime I am still recycling slightly used jeans into handbags. I made this one with leather accents first: Last night I finished this tulip/denim handbag. Can\'t you just see this one with denim capris, navy shell and pink jacket? Maybe some denim flip flops with 10 pink-topped toes....Ah, what fun I am having making these to coordinate with the clothes I already own. I hardly ever wear those jean jackets in the first picture...I rarely wear jeans, but I think that may change this year. I am so happy to report that I received my 1 Cent USB cable from Amazon and it works! So now I can get back to blogging on a more regular basis. The cable postage was only $1.56, so I guess you guys were correct in saying they made their profit from the shipping ($7.49). But still it was a reasonable price and I am a happy customer! I am still waiting for the camera cord. I got an email stating that it has shipped, so I am pretty sure it\'s not a scam. It said it would arrive between Feb. 28 and March 15. March 15! I hope it\'s not that long. In the meantime, I found a friend\'s laptop to use to pull up my pics without the cable. I\'ve been cooking a lot. Last Sunday I had an oven full of ribs, baked chicken,blueberry muffins and oven-roasted carrots. There is nothing like an oven roasted carrot--they were like eating candy! All I do is toss with a bit of vegetable oil, salt and pepper and bake in 350 - 400 degree oven. This time I used 350 since that\'s what the other items needed. I had them on the top shelf before I put the ribs in. We\'ve been eating this food all week. I won\'t have to cook until Friday night when I have to do fish. No cooking during the week gives me more time to play after work. I made this handbag and am now working on some denim projects. I can\'t believe that this week is almost over already! Who sells a $40 cable for one cent? Is it just a mistake? My Kodak camera USB cord has a short or something because I have not been able to pull pictures from my camera for the past week. Every time I plug it in, it kills the USB port (and my Internet access) and I have to restart the computer to reset the USB and internet access. I am not sure it\'s the cable. The camera itself could be toast, That\'s why I have not been posting. What\'s a post without a picture? I bought my camera about two years ago at Staples. I went there today and they were no help at all. The young man said they could not order a new cable. What\'s up with that? I bought it locally instead of online so I could get service. I guess I may as well just buy online. If I can find a cable, they should be able to. After I got home, I googled it and found that Amazon had the USB cable and it was 1 cent. Yes, 1 cent! I thought this must be a mistake, but I ordered it anyway, thinking that if it\'s really a few dollars more, that\'s O.K. because I need it. Who would bother to sell something for one cent? It\'s not even worth typing out the a,\'ress label for one cent. When I finished the order it indeed came up as one cent + $7.49 Shipping. The total price charged to my credit card was $7.50. Now I am worried that it\'s some sort of scam. Does Amazon have scams? Do you think I will really get this item? My time has been consumed with getting the piecing of this quilt top finished. It consists of 196 3-inch pieces, which took a lot longer than I anticipated and I cannot find the words to convey my level of happiness to be finished with the piecing! I tossed it over the table to see how it looked with my Valentine flowers. In between sewing bouts, I read blogs, where through the wonder of the Internet, I learned a new skill. Not in a million years would I have thought that I would be surfing the recent updates to quilting blogs and learn how to do this... Yes, I learned how to fold the dangling end of my TP into this lovely little fan. What fun! Now that is worthy of a Domestic Go,\'ess label! :)I can\'t wait to have company over so I can test out their reaction. . . LOL. I can just hear my burly brother-in-law if he should be lucky guest number 1 (because it\'s only good for the first person in and then it\'s gone). You can learn how to do this, too. Just visit this post at Spun Sugar Qults. One afternoon I streamlined my morning jewelry hunt. I was storing all my costume jewelry in the little boxes they came in. The trouble was that I had to open them all to find out what was inside. That wasn\'t so bad when I only had a few. But as you can see I have amassed quite a collection in the past two years. I did not even remember what I had. Now they are all out of the boxes and into clear bags so I can tell at a glance what there. Now that I have finished the quilt, I hope to be a better blogger.

In fact, he helped write a song for Has Been, Shatner\'s acclaimed album of prose-poems set to music. So when Shatner came to the Nashville Film Festival last year to introduce William Shatner\'s Gonzo Ballet, a well-received documentary inspired by Has Been, Brad invited him to spend some time over at the Paisley family farm. \'And I\'ll tell you one of the strangest things I\'ve ever seen,\' Paisley says. \'I came home from the recording studio, and [Shatner] was already over at the house, playing with my two-year-old son in the basement ó with light sabers. I walked in to see my son and Capt. Kirk, dueling with light sabers. I looked over at my wife, and asked: ëWhat the hell kind of bizarre universe have I just walked into here?\' As you know, when you can\'t travel to spend a Major Holiday with your loved ones, it\'s traditional to call in during the celebration. Shatmoy = Major Holiday, therefore ... well, you do the math. That\'s right! If you want to be part of the podcast that will be recorded during the Shatmoy party on Saturday, March 27 (more info here ), let us know by a,\'ing a comment to this blog entry, a note at the Event page , or email lookathisbutt.gmail.com. Details later but you\'ll probably need to download Skype (it\'s free!) Ricky blogged about this today :\'I\'ll be hanging with The Shatmeister.\'The deets : William Shatner, best known as Star Trek\'s Captain Kirk, will receive the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2010 Banff World Television Festival. After more than 5 decades in the business, Shatner has continually leveraged his fame to build enduring properties as a director, producer, author, recording artist, screenwriter and spokesperson. A brand unto himself, Shatner\'s next project is the recently announced Sh-t My Dad Says, based on the popular Twitter account that\'s infamous for quotes like\'A parent\'s only as good as their dumbest kid. If one wins a Nobel Prize but the other gets robbed by a hooker, you failed.\'Register now to hear from William as he shares thoughts and lessons from his career in an interview open to all Banff World Television Festival delegates. And about Ricky: Known around the world as the creator of The Office and Extras, as well as a renowned comedian and actor, Ricky Gervais has been selected as the winner of this year\'s Sir Peter Ustinov Comedy Award.\'This is probably the greatest honour of my career. Only the Nobel Peace Prize can top this, but I will only accept that in person if the ceremony is held somewhere as beautiful as Banff. I think they Fedex luckily,\'said Gervais. In a,\'ition to accepting the prestigious award, Gervais will share his reflections on his career and achievements in an interview open to Banff World Television Festival attendees.

March 2002. It\'s March, and as such, I am going to pay homage to my little sister, Katie. For some reason beyond my comprehension, my little sister is such a muse to me when I\'m making a cake. For example, she inspired this beauty of 2008. March 2008. And last year I designed a cute little button-themed cake that I never got around to actually making. :( She did get a cake, so don\'t worry about that! She and her winterguard cohorts celebrated with a Publix cake that day. This year, I definitely plan on making her another fabulous cake, since I\'ll be home for spring break, but I\'m digressing... One of my favorite cakes ever was also inspired by and created for Katie: March 2007. Isn\'t it a beauty? All those different elements... the Royal Icing cauldron, the fondant leprechaun, the hard candy rainbow... If you were wondering, yes, I did make that rainbow all by myself. I made &amp; colored the hard candy all by myself, I melted it in the oven and made a rainbow shape and made a second one just in case this one broke... all on my own. And let me tell you, it was a lot of work! But so, so worth it, right? I can\'t take all of the credit either... Little sisters aren\'t good for much... ;) But my little sis has the ability to push my skills and talents past the limit and help me grow as a person... or at least, a cake decorator. So, Katie, this one\'s for you. For taking me out of my comfort zone and asking for the craziest, wildest cake ideas and believing that I\'ll actually be able to create them. Love ya, chica! If you noticed, there was recently a poll on the blog about your favorite cupcake flavors. According to TLC Cooking , these are the 10 most popular cupcake flavors: Chocolate &amp; Vanilla-- It\'s classic, simple, and has something for everyone. Red Velvet-- \'Nuff said Carrot Cake-- Vegetables in cupcake form? Oh yeah. Peanut Butter-- Why didn\'t I think of this combo?? Lemon-- If life gives you lemons, make lemon cupcakes Chocolate-- a personal favorite Coffee-- One of the few times I love coffee Banana-- I love banana bread but never tried a banana cupcake Pumpkin--&nbsp; one of my favorites Vanilla-- Booooring ;) And according to my blog readers, these are the favorites: Chocolate/vanilla combo-- Surprise! But what do you like better: chocolate icing with vanilla cake, or vanilla icing with chocolate cake? Chocolate with chocolate frosting Vanilla with vanilla frosting-- apparently y\'all aren\'t very adventurous with your favorite cupcakes. Chocolate...vanilla...chocolate...vanilla... But the people have spoken! Strawberry and&nbsp;Red Velvet tied for fourth German Chocolate, Lemon, and Banana are fifth Carrot Cake, Coffee, Coconut, and Peanut Butter all got one vote each for 6th place Mostly I was just curious about what other people think of cupcakes. In my family it\'s pretty biased: the majority wants a chocolate cupcake, but there are strong contenders for lemon and vanilla. However, depending on how things go, I might put this information to use when (if) I participate as a vendor in my town\'s annual arts &amp; crafts fair. I want to sell cupcakes, cookies, and cake balls, but I\'m not sure if I\'ll be able to, due to time constraints and the like. I\'ll be sure to keep y\'all posted though! I haven\'t posted in a while, so I thought I\'d share some of my older creations. First up, we have the truck road race cake I made for James\' fourth birthday. He\'s 11 now, so that was seven years ago. (Wow! That was really long ago) What do you think? Has my decorating skills improved since then?? ;) Next up is a haunted house. I think I made this one four or five years ago. I was still learning about piping and coloring icing... so the coloring is a bit off. But those are some awesome ghosts, right?! And finally, the pirate cake. Man, oh man, I remember this cake. I definitely made it three or four years ago, and my blood sugar was screwing up, so I wasn\'t in my best creative mood. And the icing had little chocolate chips in it, which was way too frustrating. Ta-da! Not too shabby, all things considered. That\'s all the cake I\'ve got to show off for right now. :-) I applied for some jobs this week, since I have a car now, so send some good wishes and prayers my way! I definitely want to start decorating cakes on a more regular basis. So these are the first ever Superbowl cookies that I ever made, way back in 2007. In \'08 I made little footballs In \'09 I made footballs and helmets As you can tell, I\'ve come a long way since the Bears played the Colts. &nbsp;I now use Royal Icing instead of buttercream (and the proper consistency of RI) to decorate the cookies, and I found appropriate cookie cutters. If the horse looks a little funny to you, it\'s because I had to find a picture off the computer and trace that-- I didn\'t have a horse cookie cutter! (I do now, though, thankfully!) This year, unfortunately, I won\'t be able to make Superbowl cookies, since I\'ll be away at school, instead of attending the annual church party like I have the past 3 years. But I hope you enjoyed this little flashback into the past, and enjoy watching the game tomorrow night! (Or, not. I don\'t even think I\'ll be watching it, but who knows?) Today, two of my friends told me that they\'re working on a new project, involving their future career and/or favorite hobby. And I thought, I need a project of my own . So... if anyone could loan me an oven, a few pieces of wood, a jigsaw, an industrial-size mixer, and probably a blowtorch, I\'ll get to work on it. Or maybe I\'ve just been watching too many episodes of Ace of Cakes? But in all seriousness, I did come up with a cool new cake design which may or may not defy the laws of gravity. It might have to be a summer project though, because it is seriously epic. More details later :D Everything hurts: My back is sore from leaning over. My legs and feet ache from standing up all day. My arms tire from kneading. My clothes and face and new apron are covered in sugar. But I couldn\'t be happier. I got to bake. And I believe, without a doubt, that baking is the surest way to cure stress. For me at least. There\'s just something so relaxing about going through the motions of rolling out dough, and thinking on your feet when you can\'t find an ingredient, solving problems like too-hot ovens, and finding the best creative way to decorate. I can just let go of all of my problems (and let me tell you, last week was problematic for me) and focus on that task in front of me. So thankfully my very good friend Joy took me home to bake with her and Megan and her awesome parents bought cookie mix and let me have run of the kitchen :) It may not have been the weekend I was hoping for, but I have a fresh outlook on life. Especially since there is a tupperware of a couple dozen sugar cookies (decorated with marshmallow fondant ... I actually did a pretty stellar job this time! I don\'t think anybody ever tells you what a sticky, gross mess it makes at first and how long it takes to knead, but by God, I did it right!) and a popcorn cake in my dorm. Life is good. I would like to sell some of my baked goods (cookies, cake balls, cupcakes, etc) this summer at our city\'s annual crafts fair. I remember last year I thought about selling crocheted items, but that is a lot of time to invest so I sorta scratched that idea. And I like cookies better anyway. :-) But I don\'t know what the laws are like in my state (Georgia)... do I need a licensed or commercial kitchen? Or is my home kitchen sufficient? Do I need a permit to sell at this festival? It\'s just a one-time deal, maybe I\'ll do it again the next year if it\'s a success. So if you know the answers or where I can find information, I would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks!!! XOXO, Kelsie Ta-Da! Here are the finished cupcakes that I alluded to yesterday, and they are all in their entirety (unlike yesterday, when I started eating the gingerbread man before I took a picture). Oh, wait. That guy in front looks a little crippled. &nbsp;Well, to be fair, they are irresistibly yummy. I started out with a box of turtle brownie mix that my grandma gave me, and a sleeve of 500 Christmas cupcake liners. And so, the idea of brownies that look like cupcakes was born! Plus, it was a snow day, and I was stuck inside because of the below freezing weather and icy road conditions. Be warned, though, that the brownies stuck to the cupcake liners. Maybe it was the caramel? Or maybe I should\'ve sprayed Pam on them first? I\'m really not sure about that o,\' phenomenon, but if you have any ideas, let me know so I can improve next time. Then, since I had this really cute idea in my head about snowflake sprinkles and tiny gingerbread men, I wanted to decorate them... You can\'t really tell, but that\'s a 2-foot piping bag I\'ve got in my hands. When I decided I needed a bigger bag to ice cupcakes with, I figured I\'d just go with the biggest size available. Well... maybe an 18\'bag would\'ve done the job just as nicely, but without being quite so intimidating. Then came the sprinkles... And finally, the finished product! And many thanks to Sarah, who helped me out and decorated some of these cute little guys with me! I must warn you, though, that these are really sweet and rich. I think a normal chocolate cupcake would fare better with all the decorations, and leave the brownie cupcakes to stand on their own merit, with maybe a small swirl of fudge icing for garnish.

Almost a year ago today, I was told I had less than a year to live. After two months of deteriorating health, unsure diagnosis, wrong diagnosis\'s, different medications, and a mind full of questionable thoughts I was told what I feared the most. I didn\'t cry that day, or the next. I accepted my fate and I remember just trying to show everyone in my life that it was okay. I came to really realize what the meaning, ëeverything in life happens for a reason\' truly meant. I figured that there was nothing but hard times to come and honestly I was okay with that. This past year has been difficult in many different aspects. I\'ve watched my family and loved ones cry with tears of sorrow and tears of joy. I\'ve had breathing tubes put in and taken out. I\'ve struggled with learning to walk again, and being able to hear my own voice after four weeks of being unable to speak. I know that the ups and downs I faced last summer are never going to even compare to the things I\'m going to encounter in the future because nothing was that difficult. If I were to experience this again, I would accept it as I did the first time around. Despite the hardships that came with what happened, I was surrounded by loved ones every single day. And if things were to happen differently, if things were to be worse, then that would be fine because I can\'t change what\'s already going to happen. The only things I can change are my attitude about it, and make the most out of what was to come. To be honest I never thought I would have had such a great turnaround. I remember thinking in the hospital that there wasn\'t anything I could do, but when things started to look better, when I was still able to lift my left hand up, when I was starting to regain a little strength I knew I couldn\'t waste it. I knew that I had to keep trying, keep fighting, and keep doing my best to get past whatever it was that was holding me back. Even to this day despite multiple doctors\' visits, MRIs, cardio appointments, etc, the doctors are still unsure of what exactly happened to me. They think it\'s an isolated case, a onetime occurrence, but they said they couldn\'t say that for certain. All I know is that without the love and support of the people around me, the people I don\'t know, the amazing hospital staff at Children\'s (21 is the age limit there! Aha!) I wouldn\'t be where I am today. You all made me keep fighting, you all gave me the strength I needed to push myself, your support kept me from giving up in the moments where that\'s all I wanted to do. So thank you for your thoughts, for your prayers, and for just showing me love in the time where I needed it the most. And I hope that you all know I appreciate everything you\'ve all done, and I care about each and every one of you (even if I don\'t know you, or we don\'t speak anymore). I wish you all the best, and I will keep doing my best to make a difference in this world and to show you all that your thoughts weren\'t wasted. Hi everyone, I haven\'t updated this blog much lately on account of there isn\'t any news for me to share with you all in regards to my health, plus I update my personal blog. Other than the good news of my life has returned to normal, and whatever in my brain has been shrinking, there isn\'t much for me to a,\'. I have a math final tommorow, and this quarter is pretty much over and done with. Also been working around 4 days a week. Been saving up money for my big trip. I thought you might all want to see the MRI\'s I had done, these are just two. My first one ever taken, and the circled red area is actually the inflammation (what I shall refer to it as) its\' really big that\'s why the doctors were so insistant that it was a tumor. This was taken in June of 2008. This second picture is a different angle, and the circled area is the spot/what\'s left of the inflammation. It\'s pretty much smaller than a pea, which is great news. This picture was taken October 2008. A very big change in 5-6 months. I just wanted to say thank yuo all again for everything, and for keeping me in your prayers. Also I cut off about 3-4 inches of my hair yesterday, so here\'s what I look like as of right now! Maybe I should upload a video of me doing a strenous exercise or something to show you guys my progress! First of all, I feel exteremy lucky and blessed to able to share good, no great news with you all. It\'s almost as if I\'ve been given another chance to make the most out of my life. God has blessed me with great people, and a challenge, that I am overcoming. Today I went to Childrens to get the results of my MRI from last week. The neurologist told me that they still don\'t have a clear idea of what it is, or what made it occur. The tests they sent out over the summer with my blood, etc all came back negative/normal. So that\'s a pretty good sign. Then she showed me pictures of my brain. She showed me the original MRI picture from back in August which showed a very large white spot in my medula, and then she showed me the picture from last week\'s MRI, and the white spot seems to almost be gone now. Which means that my brain is getting back to normal (the color), and it\'s only got a very little spot of gray/white left. So everything is getting better, and they want to keep me on surveilance for awhile. My next MRI is going to be in January before my trip, and then after that I only need to get an MRI every 6 months, so things are going good! Also on another note I recently came into news in regards to some people that I do not know. And it\'s really sad because sometimes its so hard to believe that some people are so unhappy to the point where they need to end their own lives. I know people suffer, and people hurt but I just wish people didn\'t hurt to that point, that extent. Life is so precious and we\'re all only given one. Maybe someone had a bad day, maybe someone had a lot of bad days, maybe it was just a fluke. I don\'t know, what I do know is that we all have the power to make other people feel better about their situations, whether it be by offering a smile, giving wave, being courteous, or even holding a door. We all have the power to do something and to brighten someones day, so we should. Why let people suffer quietly? Why let people harbor pain? Why let people think that no one cares when we do? This whole sitaution has changed my outlook on life, and the values of family and friends. There\'s never a moment now where I don\'t want to do something for other people, and it\'s not because oh \'I should\', it\'s because I want to. And I hope you all want to bring happiness to others, even if you don\'t know them. Sometimes all they need is one person to show them that things can be okay, and that strangers care. You\'ve all shown me you care and for that I am eternaly thankful, without it I don\'t know where I would be. For the past two or so weeks I\'ve been having headaches, they\'re not bad headaches, nor do they hurt. They\'re just annoying, and on the same side of my head every time. So my follow up MRI and Neurology appointment isn\'t until November 17 and 18, however I saw my doctor on Tuesday and she made a call and I had an MRI this morning at 7:15...Which was very early, especially for me. I had to leave at 6 am! But the MRI went well, and I\'m just waiting to hear from Neurology in regards to how the scan/my brain looks. I hope that things continue to improve for me, and apart of me knows things will, things always get better. But if they don\'t, then that\'s okay too, becasue everything happens for a reason. I\'m not scared or worried in regards to any of this business going on, I\'m just trying to make the most out of everything in my life at this point. School\'s not bad, but doing a full load online sure is not that fun! I started working again too, 4 days a week, it\'s not bad either. I need something to keep me busy. My friends have been great, hanging out, treating me like I\'m normal again. Which I\'d like to think I am, other than the fact that I have to take heart medication. I feel like things are normal for me again, and I feel my old life habits resurfacing. Althoguh some are difficult to ignore, others aren\'t. I still am striving towrads a better life, etc. And today I realzied what one of my possible careers is/will be. I have a few, but this one I really want to see out. I\'ll update once I get the results of my MRI. Thank you for checking this blog, and for praying for me. I cannot stress enough how much I appreciate everything you have all done for me. The world needs more people like this. Also dont\' forget to vote! Hey all, Some news for you, (finally an update) I had a cardiology appointment a week or two ago, and they said that basically I\'m giong to have to stasy on my heart medication. I had a few episodes when I was in the hospital where my heart would beat up to 200 bpm. So anyway my heart still does a fast beat sometimes out of nowhere but not anywhere near as bad, almost like i went for a run and its beating, trying to slow down. I had a followup appointment wtih the whole rehab team today, and basically i\'m doing really good. my strength\'s come back, etc. They even told me that they hadn\'t ever seen such a big turnaround ever. So my appointment went well, and i\'m basically cleared for driving/traveling. Even though I started driving again a few weeks ago aha! I have a followup with Neurology in November and another MRI in November, and hopefully it shows another improvement! On another note, tommorow is my last day of Physical Therapy! :) Thank you all for the continued prayers. Sorry for the delay, it\'s hard to come up with things to say especially when your days consist of physical therapy, exercises, and hanging out. I thought it would be boring and repetitive to tell you all the same thing, over and over again. Anyways I\'ve got a slew of doctors appointments coming up in the next few weeks, (probably something I mentioned before). Things are going well for me, I\'m still trying to do my best. I find myself growing snappier at my family over little things, and I\'m trying to stop that because it\'s uneccesary. And besides a happy wennie is a better wennie! :) On to some intresting news! I finally got my new tattoo yesterday, I was stuck between two choices. The first was the word \'rescued\' because I feel like everything that happened to me in a way saved my life. I mean it sounds stupid, but apart of me really feels as if this was supposed to happen. Almost like the life I was living before just wasn\'t good enough, and this thing that happeend to me, forced me to accept things that I didn\'t want to or could accept before, forced me to push harder, forced me to just be better, to live better. That\'s why I feel like this thing that happened inside of my brain rescued me, it rescued me from my own life. I don\'t care if people think it\'s stupid, or dumb because it\'s got meaning to me and that\'s all that matters. It\'s a reminder of what happened, and what I need and should strive towards. It\'s also on my right arm because 1) I\'ve already got a tattoo on my left side and 2) its right under where they give me my IV\'s for my MRI\'s (just another reminder that I\'ve still gotta keep pushing and giong). I\'ll try to come up with more intresting things to tell you guys, therapy is going well and the strength is returning and almost equal at least in my legs. I think it\'s almost the same in my arms too! I feel like my health is improving, and I\'m putting on weight! Below is a picture of my new ink. Thank you for your continued prayers and good thoughts! I will do my best to update more frequently! Hi everyone, I\'ve been home for almost two weeks now and things are going very well. The tingling and numbness I felt before I entered the hospital have gone, and I feel my body becoming normal again (back to what it used to). I still do physical therapy and I\'m diong it three times a week, and after next week it\'ll be reduced down to two times a week. I\'m able to sprint now and squat down, which dosen\'t seem like much but for me it\'s a big improvement. I remember the first time I tried to squat down I fell, also the pain in my legs is gone when I walk so it\'s easier for me now to be walking a lot. I have another followup in two months for my MRI, and a cardiology appointment in the next few weeks to see if I need to stay on my heart medicine, and a follow up with the rehab doctors (all my therapists too!) at the end of september to make sure i\'m on track. I plan on doing a full course load at school this quarter, joining a gym, working on my business, and getting a job as a mentor at a non-profit clinic. Things are looking up and I\'m pretty happy. Below is a picture I put together from my time in the hospital to show yuo all the differences. Thank you all again for everything yuo\'ve done for me, and for praying for me and keeping me in yuor thoughts. I\'m home! I\'ve been home since yesterday and it\'s so nice to be back again. Things have been going pretty well here, I start physical therapy at Olympic on Tuesday for 3 days a week, my previous PT therapist only thinks I need it for a month so hopefuly its only that long! No traveling at least until January but that\'s okay, I decided not to drop out of school and continue to do a full load this fall all online though! The doctors still are unsure of my diagnosis. I had an MRI yesterday and it showed another slight improvement. My next one is scheduled for two months from now, which is when my follow up appointment is. Hopefully things continue to progress at this rate. :) Thank you all again for everything you\'ve done for me!
Slickly produced programs were provided on chairs, but it was too dark for ad broads to read, even by the light of their iphones. So I had no idea that Ad Broad was a finalist. Honestly, hadn\'t seriously considered that a blogspotter who can\'t speak a speck of html could be thought of as a\'hero of the internet.\'Halfway through the ceremony, my companion and housing host announced she wasn\'t well (maybe the chicken-fried chicken?) and I drove her home. What a thrill to receive news (via twitter of course) that Ad Broad won in the Advertising blog category.Congrats to all winners including Deep Focus, Firstborn, RGA and others. Lucky for us and appropriate to the category that prizes are items more practical than dust-gathering engraved statuettes: flash drives.  Thanks to you who kindly voted on this proposed panel last Fall, I\'m on my way to Austin where @BettyDraper will be presenting a session on Brand Fiction: what the heck is it? What can it do for your brand? How to integrate it into current marketing efforts? It\'s been recommended as a top SXSW panel for business and highlighted in SXSWorld and by the sharp folks at Razorfish. If you\'re putting your SXSW schedule together, hope you\'ll consider joining @Roger_Sterling (Michael Bissell) and me at 3:30 on Saturday for\'Rules of Brand Fiction from Twittering Mad Men.\'A little fun before happy hour! Brilliant marketing move for two companies: the newest line of Barbies will include men-Mad Men. According to the New York Times today
Some gorgeous flower pcs made by Rita Saardi as a premise of beautiful dancers wearing silk dresses for Peter Copping / Nina Ricci. I had blogged about Rita\'s beautiful work in a previous post here . This talented bu,\'ing fashion designer (who is definitely going places) was recently invited by the house of Nina Ricci to collaborate with head designer Peter Copping for the Fall 2011 show. You can follow this exciting adventure with her on her blog here . You go girl! x Designed by Georg Bohle , this cool oak dining table neatly conceals an electric piano. Just lift up on the wooden tablet cut into one edge and you are ready to dazzle your dinner guests (via cribcandy ). I am so fantasizing about being living in a house like this. I love everything about it, everthing down to the pirate flag. (photography by Anitta Behrendt ) I simply love these dino wallpaper by Paperboy , the wallpaper specialists for boys. Would be lovely if they also had the decal versions of this of these dinosaurs! Available here ! I love these vintage lamps by Kathleen Hills. The vintage glass shades have been sourced by Kathleen and given a contemporary twist. I think thse beautiful hanging lights will a,\' just the right touch of soft vintage style to any bedroom. I love the simple and modern look of these chairs by American designer Von Tundra . Built with domestic white oak, these chairs (named the prairie chair) are inspired by reductive modernism and the farmer-made furniture of the American Midwest.

Post note: Little bunny died about three hours after I brought him in house. I\'m sure the stress was just too much for him. He seemed to be picking up some speed at one point. It is all for the better. He was warm and cared for. I found a wounded bunny near a hay pile I was moving by the lamb stalls this morning. He had tucked himself into the safest spot he could, and squeaked when I was near by. His hind leg has a puncture wound, through to the bone. He\'s alive, but I\'ve had my Dr. Quinn episodes with bunnies, wildlife doesn\'t fare well with human interference even when well intended. I imagine a cat got him. I iodined it after saline bath. He is more alert than when I found him, and I have him at my desk safe from puppies and wandering felines. Not sure if he will make it. He\'ll die attended though, although the sounds of the dogs playing is probably not helping. He is calm when held. The wandering array of life continues, as does pending death. These little episodes are not meant to distress, but to remind us of the bigger picture. Life is temporary, and can be snapped away in a bite by man or beast. The conflict of having compassion for but raising livestock to sustain me, the conflict of helping a bunny that eats my food...intertwined. Lilly had her lambs last night. She finally started labor around six p.m. and we came to the barn a few times to find her still in pre labor. This early morning we arrived to find lambs, two beauties. The male is very large, and already eating a little grass this usually doesn\'t happen for a few days or more.] The girl is this wonderful strawberry blonde. Sadly, on my second trip to the barn, she had torn her eyelid on a piece of the lambing pen - I treated with saline and antibiotic and think it will heal fine. Lilly is one of our work horse sheep - always calm, and stoic. She\'s a big girl who throws strong lambs. I was concerned she had held out this long, as we never have lambs past 3/12...and of course my over active imagination drummed up all sorts of possibilities. I tortured myself by re-reading my sheep books about possible causes, and lay in bed last night with visions of Lilly lying in breach birth trauma...but I guess Mlle. Nature just wasn\'t ready to pop those two out, and they arrived very mature - with ears already standing by morning. Normally I wait at least one day to put mom and lambs out, but it\'s sunny and warm, and Lilly is an old pro. It\'s less stressful than being separated from the flock. They develop so much faster - I find - when they can go outside. I want to thank all the nice thoughts people held for us this season- I have to say, I feel like a boulder has been lifted off my chest. The trauma of last year really made a mark on me, and Martyn, and it showed this season. We lost the stillborn girl, and I still fret about the surviving twin\'s rattle, but all in all, we are pleased. And relieved. As the last ewe to lamb, Lilly rests, and waits. And one of Audrey\'s boys catches some sunny zzzzz\'s. On what most likely was a chilly March 10th in 1958, in a hospital room at St. Mary\'s in Rochester, Minnesota, I came bolting into the world at precisely 10:18 PM. And so begins the story which over the years has reached mythical proportions- how I almost killed my mother on my birthday. Perhaps it is one reason I chose to never have children - my own mother terrified the heck out of me with my own birth story. In all seriousness, my mother did almost bleed to death, and I have this scar she likes to point out on my forehead from the momentous occasion. Supposedly my father looked pale and upset when he saw me because I was pink and red and lobster like, where as my brother came out a year earlier looking like JFK - seriously, for years my mother compared my brother\'s looks to JFK. I was compared to a lobster. And hours before I barged out of the womb, my father had been called to the morgue, where his 57 year old mother lay dead, of a heart attack, diabetes related. Her untimely death led me to receive her name, Katherine, instead of Bridgette which my mother had picked out. I cant imagine being named Bridgette, although as a child I liked to tell this story, since Bridgette Bardot was all the rage, and as a chubby little redhead, I thought BB was quite the cat\'s pajamas. So I can only imagine the yin and yang and surreal quality of that cold March night for my father. I wonder if there were things that brought it all back to him as he aged. Did the sound of heels on a linoleum floor late at night bring back a sensation of the events he dealt with that night? As I get older, 52 years older to be exact, I can understand how this moment is burned into my mother, or father, in some kind of post traumatic stress way. But being true Minnesotans, we carried on, and every year, my mother made me one of my favorite layer cakes- at the time it was white cake with pink butter frosting. In time, my tastes changed to German chocolate, or her white cake with chocolate frosting. I still have the same recipe cards she hand wrote so many years ago, all spotted with vanilla stains. While I appreciate that I was born, I am not one of the people out there saying that birth is beautiful. In fact, I couldn\'t disagree more. It\'s an intimate moment of a mother creature being out of control of her body. Miraculous, yes, but not beautiful. I get just about as much birth as I need on the farm, thank you very much , and all the blood, after birth and vaginal prolapses that come with it. I think birth is traumatic, terrifying, bloody and completely chaotic. It\'s a mess. In fact, it makes no sense. A creature pushed out of a keyhole - that\'s not beautiful, it\'s bizarre. It\'s a miracle, but it\'s not beautiful. But it\'s the only way to get a foot in the door, isn\'t it? Staying in a womb all your life would be safe, and warm, and inexpensive - no taxes, no maniacs on the radio shouting at you. But there would be no grand entrance, no kisses, no pie made with the first strawberries, no front row seats to Neil Young. No puppies. No showers on a hot day. No hand to hold when a father dies and no little mouths to feed when a mother dies. No matter what creatures come into your life, mothering is the beautiful part of birth. That some one would go through that trauma to give another creature a way to get their foot in the door of this big, messy place called life. The winds have come in, it\'s bone chilling. All day I was carried back to a place I liked to hide when I was little, a grove of sumac bushes out behind our house. Alone, I felt protected, but spooked at the same time. Rushing back to the house, I\'d hear the wind blowing buckets and roof tops, and it felt scary like the Wizard of Oz. But home was warm, there was homemade cake even on my non birthday. It wasn\'t messy. It\'s like that today - the sounds of the barn roof rattling in the wind are spooky, but I feel safe in the barn, surrounded by my mothering ewes. Together with my flock, I experienced the trauma of last year\'s lambing, and just like my mother did after my birth, I carry that trauma with me in a little surface wound, in danger of getting reopened if I bump it just right. I realized it\'s my very own birth story, and it\'s required if one expects to find a sense of place in this messy world. March 10, Post Note: Daisy presented my with two healthy lambs this morning, a perfect way to start my birthday. They\'ve made it 8 hours...we\'ll hope they do well tonight. They appear okay. I saw some tail wiggling while at the u,\'er [ asign they are getting milk]. When I saw these pictures, I was quite amused at their expressions. Amazing how they adapt. We are grateful for the sun and warmer weather, to help our lambing week along. These are Fern\'s lambs, now one week old. We had hoped more of the girls would lamb this weekend - perfect weather. I knew everyone of the 5 ewes was ready to pop, but I like to keep them up and atom until they really go down into labor. The new mothers can surprise you though - I once had a new mom wa,\'ling casually back to the barn with her baby half way out. So last night I was pretty sure Nelly Moser would lamb. And she did. I have been somewhat concerned about what type of mother Nelly would be- of all our sheep she is somewhat flighty. Arriving at the barn, there she was with two fresh lambs, probably born around 8 am. But she wasn\'t caring to them very proficiently- she wasn\'t licking them or chortling much. One was quite dopey looking and chilled, not a good sign. I checked her u,\'er and she had milk, and both ram lambs did suck on my finger, another good sign. I opted not to tube them [a procedure where you insert a stomach tube and force feed], and gave him milk from my finger instead. I decided to take them outside since it is sunny and much warmer outside than the cool barn. Nelly was just a bit clueless, but she\'s adapting. She is chortling more, and can get them to the u,\'er, but she\'s not as good as the pros at helping them \'get it\'. She did not dry them off well either, and I had to step in and help. Within a half hour, I had them warmed up, thanks to the towel and the sun. We will just have to watch them and see. In the last 3 hours, I think both mother and lambs are adjusting to the newness of everything. And the other girls wait...here\'s Lilly, who I\'m sure will go soon. In fact, they are all showing signs of pending labor. The rules of this game are simple: wait...watch...then run with all your heart to where ever the guy in front of you runs.
I\'ve just got back from the hairdresser\'s, and talking to you. I left at 5.00, and have just got back. I don\'t know whether I should feel ridiculous or relieved. Maybe (and you know who you are) you\'ll email and let me know. 1 January 2010 From John O\'Donohue (1956-2008), a blessing for your New Year: Beannacht (\'Blessing\') On the day when the weight deadens on your shoulders and you stumble, may the clay dance to balance you. And when your eyes freeze behind the grey window and the ghost of loss gets in to you, may a flock of colours, indigo, red, green, and azure blue come to awaken in you a meadow of delight. When the canvas frays in the currach of thought and a stain of ocean blackens beneath you, may there come across the waters a path of yellow moonlight to bring you safely home. May the nourishment of the earth be yours, may the clarity of light be yours, may the fluency of the ocean be yours, may the protection of the ancestors be yours. And so may a slow wind work these words of love around you, an invisible cloak to mind your life. Sorry haven\'t been here for a while. Trying to go forwards...Hope you are all well and using up the last of the year well. During the week I got onto a tube in London feeling very tired and despondent, as you often do cramming onto a tube at rush hour, and without a book to read I stared up at the adverts and amongst them was this poem. It is called \'Prayer\' and was almost in answer to one in that moment, and was so lovely I thought I\'d put it here. I hope you think so too... PRAYER - Carol anne Duffey Some days, although we cannot pray, a prayer utters itself. So a woman will lift her head from the sieve of her hands and stare at the minims sung by a tree, a su,\'en gift. Some nights, although we are faithless, the truth enters our hearts, that small familiar pain; then a man will stand stock-still, hearing his youth in the distant Latin chanting of a train. Pray for us now. Grade 1 piano scales console the lodger looking out across a Midlands town. Then dusk, and someone calls a child\'s name as though they named their loss. Darkness outside. Inside the radio\'s prayer - Rockall. Malin. Dogger. Finisterre Not sure why, but this poem seems appropriate today. Sonnet to Orpheus Oh you gentle ones, every once in a while step into the breath that is indifferent to you, let it be parted on your cheeks, behind you it trembles, reunited. Oh you blessed ones, oh you whole ones, you who seem to be the beginning of the hearts. Bow of arrows and target of arrows, your smile beams eternally with tears. Do not fear to suffer the heaviness, give it back to earth\'s weight: heavy are the mountains. Heavy are the oceans. Even what you planted as children, the trees, have long become too heavy; you could not carry them. But the breezes... but the spaces... Psalm 91 for my sins, this for pleasure. I wish I had written it... To An English Friend In Africa ó Ben Okri Be grateful for the freedom to see other dreams. Bless your loneliness as much as you drank of your former companionships. All that you are experiencing now, will become moods of future joys. So bless it all. Do not think your way superior to another\'s. Do not venture to judge, but see things with fresh and open eyes. Do not condemn, but praise when you can, and when you can\'t, be silent. Time now is a gift for you. A gift of freedom to think and remember and understand the ever perplexing past and to recreate yourself anew in order to transform time. Live while you are alive. Learn the ways of silence and wisdom. Learn to act, learn a new speech. Learn to be what you are in the seed of your spirit. Learn to free yourself from all the things that have moulded you and which limit your secret and undiscovered road. Remember that all things which happen to you are raw materials. Endlessly fertile. Endlessly yielding of thoughts that could change your life and go on doing so forever. Never forget to pray and be thankful for all things good or bad on the rich road; for everything is changeable so long as you live while you are alive. Fear not, but be full of light and love. Fear not, but be alert and receptive. Fear not, but act decisively when you should. Fear not, but know when to stop. Fear not, for you are loved by me. Fear not, for death is not the real terror, but life magically is. Be joyful in your silence, be strong in your patience. Do not try to wrestle with the universe, but be sometimes like water or air, sometimes like fire, and constant like the earth. Live slowly, think slowly, for time is a mystery. Never forget that love requires always that you be the greatest person you are capable of being, self-regenerating and strong and gentle--your own hero and star. Love demands the best in us. To always and in time oversome the worst and lowest in our souls. Love the world wisely. It is love alone that is the greatest weapon and the deepest and hardest secret. So fear not, my friend. The darkness is gentler than you think. Be grateful for the manifold, dreams of creation, and the many ways of the unnumbered peoples. Be grateful for life as you live it. And may a wonderful light always guide you on the unfolding road. Today it was the smell of lilacs that got me. I turned a corner, on a road I\'d never walked down before, quite close to home, and bang... There I was a child of seven or eight again, dragging her feet on the way to the big houses under the railway bridge, where on some Sunday mornings, a tiny lady who lived in one of them sold us rhubarb, and bunches of mint for potatoes. Delicious smells...but before we got to them, we walked with our huge bundles of rhubarb along a crescent-shaped road that was full of (what I now know to be) lilacs, and the smell cleared everything else from your mind. For a while, everything...One of the saving graces of childhood. To this day I love lilac - the colour, the smell, the look of them...and of course the way they make my mouth water for rhubarb crumble. I am at a writing course this weekend, given by the legendary Robert McKee ó the Los Angeles writer of the book STORY. He is an amazing teacher. I did the London course 2 years ago too, and read his book (a month or so before my own book came out), but it has taken all this time to absorb what he had to say on the level it needed to be known at; I feel like I am finally mastering story, and all that instinctive way of writing is being tamed by proper plotting and structure. I am really excited that bits of the craft are finally slipping over from right to left brain; very excited... But as he says in his book, no matter how much you think you\'ve got it sussed, you can\'t do it properly until you have actually done it! Here\'s something I re-read from his book last night, and which has stayed in my head all day. It\'s commonplace but something that really hit home...He says, once you\'ve mastered the rules of story and the conventions of the genre you have chosen to write in, put away the rules and\'Write only what you believe. Write your kind of story. The kind of story you\'d stand in line in the rain to buy.\'What fantastic advice... \'...the kind of book you\'d stand in line in the rain to buy.\'(well, actually he says\'...the kind of film you\'d stand in line in the rain to watch.\'because his course is also for screenwriters, but it\'s relevant for all forms. Just a word of warning if anyone is thinking of going to his next course (and he does them in countries around the world)...Two years ago I got lambasted by him because my phone went off during the first day of the 3 day course, when he had forbi,\'en us to have phones on in the auditorium. He fined me £10, the total sum of money I had on me for lunch, but he made me hand it over. (To this day I swear I don\'t know how my phone switched on, as I\'m convinced I turned it off...). I was emotionally raw because my book was about to come out, plus all that ugly stuff that was going around about me at the time, false and malicious though it all was, had finally got to me, and so the emotion his \'telling off\' brought about almost knocked me for six. I wouldn\'t have believed it possible to feel that much over \'relatively\' so little...I must have been holding all that emotion in for all that time waiting for my book to finally go public, and there in that lecture theatre I almost went into meltdown. I had shut myself down over the years, especially all those months that I was living in the car, and almost never cried anymore, about anything.... But during the 3 days of the course, I couldn\'t stop. I just couldn\'t hold back the tears, and in fact it got so bad, that on the afternoon of the last day, as we all settled down for the screening of Casablanca, I had to leave. The crying was silent of course, or as much as I could make it, but it felt like a hand had passed into my chest and was squeezing my heart over and over again, big fist-sized handfuls of it, kneading it over and over like dough, and I almost couldn\'t see for the tears, or breathe for the pain of it. And although no one else in the lecture theatre seemed to notice (who doesn\'t cry at Casablanca?) it felt like somehow he knew...I don\'t know how, but it felt like he did...and as he passed behind my seat as he briefly left the theatre for a few minutes while we continued to watch Casablanca, he slowed down and seemed to look directly at me and tears were just streaming down... He must have thought I was mad...having a slight overreaction anyhow...I think he recognises me this time too. Maybe I am just imagining that, but... Anyhow, this year I have been smart enough to leave my phone behind ó for that read, so terrified of it happening again that I didn\'t dare bring it along...The man\'s a genius, but you don\'t want to see his dark side...So be warned, if any of you decide to go to his next course, and I would absolutely recommend it, switch your phones off! You have been warned... I\'m sitting here typing this under blue skies. The busy city street below my window is full of the smell of warm blossom and, now and then, when there is the occasional lull in traffic and all you hear is the slow swish of trees from neighbouring gardens and the call of birds in flight, you can close your eyes and think yourself almost anywhere. I love days like today.
I\'m on the train as I type heading to Chicago on my way to meet up with Betsy Greer for programing at Columbia College this afternoon. It\'s so easy to forget that Milwaukee is only 1.5 hours away from Chicago, even after 9 years of living here it slips my mind. I can\'t wait to catch up with Betsy, I can\'t remember the last time we saw each other...But I think it was at the Portland premier of Handmade Nation last Spring. Man a year sure goes by quick. East coast peeps tell your friends that on Monday evening (March 8th) I\'ll be doing a screening at Syracuse University in the Watson Auditorium at 5:15pm, FREE &amp; open to the public. Have a good weekend everyone! I\'m at my hotel in Baltimore . Just had a great screening at MICA that was full of really great folks. Tomorrow I head back to Milwaukee (fingers crossed the weather stays on my side) until next Thursday. In international news I just received a pdf from Vida Simples Magazine who did an article on DIY featuring the picture of Knitta &amp; Happy Owl Glassworks from Handmade Nation the book and also Sabrina\'s book Knit Knit . AND AND AND I got my tickets for my trip to Scotland this June where I will be doing screenings and workshops in Aberdeen and Dundee ! I am SO excited, I\'ve never been to Scotland and can not wait to soak it in. Next Thursday I will be on a train to Chicago to the Cultural Studies Colloquium at Columbia College Chicago with my friend and colleague Betsy Greer . The programing starts at 3:30 with a screening of Handmade Nation and lecture by Betsy. It\'s free and open to the public. I\'m off to slumber land, the wind here in Baltimore is howling louder then hounds. Quite down wind, this lady is sleepy. Well, it was official before but now with a new blog , twitter, flickr and facebook fan page it\'s the real deal. I start shooting with my co-director Sam Macon the end of March for the Sign Painter Movie . For those of you who are interested you can now download Handmade Nation from Amazon.com I haven\'t tried it, but here it is: I will be hitting the road again on Thursday jumping a flight West to San Francisco. I am staying with the lovely Lisa Congdon and will be screening in Oakland at Rock! Paper! Scissor! this Friday at 7pm. Do pass the word on and hope to see you soon! Part of my job is to stay on top of what\'s new and exciting going on within the creative world. I have found this to become more and more difficult as I struggle to keep up with Handmade Nation and the amazing opportunities that have come out of making the documentary, including the immense travel schedule that has become a part of my life. There is just so much out there, you know? So many of you are making exciting new things and documenting them in such beautiful ways. So my question is, where is the time in my day/week/month to read all of your blogs, ingest all your amazing lifestyles and inspiration? I mean, it\'s not like I\'m out of touch at all, it\'s just that there is so much more than I can wrap my brain around. With this said, a few weeks ago Jan from Poppytalk (one of my favorite reliable blogs) got in touch as asked me to be a juror along with some other amazing ladies for her new awards she set up called\'The Poppies\'. Of course I said yes. The thing is, I often say yes to things I don\'t have time for but really want to do and per usual, I didn\'t think about the time involved with going through what ended up being 100\'s of links of those who were nominated for the categories. As a juror we were asked to pick 3 out of each category. Each category had anywhere from 20-50 nominations. There were so many amazing things and people who I hadn\'t seen before, it was really difficult to stay focused while clicking through all the nominee\'s. I had to develop a system so I could narrow it down a bit, so I made lists for each category of my favorite picks to then pick 3 from. The entire point of this post is to share with you my lists I made. I think there was so much talent showcased for the Poppies and if you want to see the jury choice winners go here. and the people\'s choice winners go here . Below are my\'working\'lists from when I was in the zone of going through 100\'s of blogs, shops and sites. I got really inspired &amp; hope you do too. Unfortunately I used my\'stickies\'to save my lists and they didn\'t save the hyperlinks, but I have linked each category to it\'s page so just scroll down once on each page and peep away!

The reasons I do love it is because I like finding out about things like\'Typeface\'. This is a new documentary (I have yet to see) about a very special place that just so happens to be in Wisconsin only a few hours away from me. This trailer is a kick in the butt to make my way up there very very soon. Keep an eye out on their website for screenings near you. Also, head on over to Blanket Magazine to download the new issue . It\'s not just any issue it\'s their 20th &amp; also the 3rd Birthday of the Magazine! You can see this feature with your\'s truly as well as interviews and artwork by a ton of people. There is also an amazing spread on jumping photos, which I am always a huge fan of (see below). A screen shot of my spread in Blanket Magazine Here I am jumping on my bed in Melbourne last year My time out East was fantastic. Like, super tops in all manners. Here is the quickest rundown possible of my 5 day jam packed trip. This is a long one.... January 15th, Day #1: The show I curated\'New Work by Merrilee Challiss and Margaret Oomen\'at Craftland Gallery opened. Merrilee flew in from Alabama and we all got to hang out. The show looks amazing, the work is stunning and I\'m glad my hunch for showing those two together was correct. Read more about the experience here . Margaret Oomen, covered sea stones Margaret Oomen, covered tea saucers Merrilee Challiss, Babylon Garden Merrilee Challiss, Temple NOTE : Artwork is available for sale online HERE + Read about Margaret donating her sale proceeds to Haiti on her blog HERE . January 16th, Day #2: I got to do some putting around Providence with Merrilee before I dropped her at the airport before my screening later that evening. Deb Dormody recommended we swing by Wolf E. Myrow. If you are curious about a magic place filled with amazing things read more about it here . Later on in the evening I had my screening at Craftland, 2 sold out shows of 40! Goccoed tickets by Heather Toupin Craftland January 17th, Day #3: Said goodbye to Providence and drove through 4 states (this blows my mind since I live in the Midwest) in 2 hours to get to Portland, ME. I drove straight to Eli Phant (one of the event sponsors) to check out their store. If you get a chance go there the owners Sally &amp; Peter have curated an amazing shop that has all sorts of perfect handmade goodness. I can\'t tell you what I bought or it will ruin someone baby shower surprise.... I got a chance to finally see Ferdinand in person, have some amazing tea, eat an incredible dinner then we all zipped over to Space Gallery for the screening. 150 people came out for the event. It was awesome. Space Gallery Right after the screening I drove off into the night as to wake up at my friends house in Belfast Maine.... January 18, Day #4: I have a group of friends who have decided to make Belfast their home . I was there for the we,\'ing ceremony last year and my second time back was just as amazing, just much chillier. One of the best parts of touring with my movie is I get to stay in touch with old friends, this is the perfect example. So breakfast was had then I headed over to Waterfall Arts for my Sunday matinee. Belfast, ME Feather, the three legged cat Skunk Man Waterfall Arts is this rad space with studios and a gallery. I was excited that 50 people came out on a gray Sunday afternoon to watch Handmade Nation . I drove for three hours after the screening since I was due in Boston the next day and there was supposed to be a big ol\' snow storm. There was. January 19th, Day #5: I woke up to this: Lucky for me I was only an hour away from Boston. I was extra super excited because I was on my way to meet up with the lovely Meighan O\'Toole who does the art blog My Love For You . Meighan and I had never met, but we have had many online discussions so both of us were really excited. She was sponsoring the Boston Screening that was happening at 4th Wall Gallery that night. Needless to say Meighan &amp; I hit it off super hard, so hard in fact I didn\'t take one single picture of her since we didn\'t stop talking the entire time. 60+ peeps came out to 4th Wall for the Boston screening that night, it was awesome. 4th Wall Gallery January 20th, Day #6 So tired from hanging out for a week straight, I had lunch with my uncle Hal &amp; flew home to Milwaukee. Thanks everyone who came out last week. It\'s much appreciated. Mucho much. The end. {More photos from the trip are here } First off, remember when Cortney Heimerl (co-author of Handmade Nation the book) was preggers last year and couldn\'t finish the last few dates of the book tour? Well, check out Abraham Edward at his glorious 7 months and how flipping cute he is. I\'m a huge fan. Second, I am very much looking forward to my trip this week to Providence , Portland ME, Belfast ME and Boston for screenings ((details listed on the sidebar to the right)). I am super EXTRA excited for these reasons: #1. I curated a very exciting show at Craftland Shop with two amazing women, Merrilee Challiss &amp; Margaret Oomen AND I get to be there for the opening AND Merrilee will be there from Birmingham, AL where she lives and runs the bangin\' spot Bottletree . I haven\'t seen Merrliee since she had a show at my gallery a few years ago and it is going to be FUN. So, if you know anyone in Providence, tell them to come to the show on Thursday, all the information is HERE . #2. I get to hang out with Deb Dormody who is one of the coordinators at Craftland, and also the talent behind IF\'N Books + Marks . Her dude Alec is also a treat to get to see. Actually Providence is full of magic, it\'s one of my favorite places in the United States. I\'m so hyped for the screening on Friday there. #3. I am hanging out in Portland Maine for the first time ever. #4. I get to go to Belfast to see my friends new baby Olai and do a screening at the same time. Last time I was in Belfast I went to this amazing we,\'ing. #5. On Monday in Boston I FINALLY get to hang out with Meighan O\' Toole from My Love For You , who organized the event there. That will be a treat. I\'ll do my best to update you from the road....Then it will almost be February. Holy crap. Back to work. Everything is a little backed up around here, I took some for reals time off the past two weeks. Had an epic dinner party at my house, took a trip to NY and ate a whole lot of amazing food. Yesterday &amp; today just sifting through emails and seeing where I left off. I\'m feeling really good about this trip East coming up, so many good people to visit in Boston MA, Providence RI and the state of Maine. I am crossing my fingers that the weather agrees with my travel plans and will update you all with new projects soon.
Have a little fashionista out there, like my Madisen?Does she give you grief every morning over what she\'s wearing?If you can relate, you\'ve got to check out ... I don\'t know about you? But, some days it\'s like really that\'s what you want to wear to school?!How nice would it be to actually love what they\'ve created to wear?Fun, Affordable &amp; as Madisen puts it \'So Awesome\' !  Still popping in from time to time, holding out hope I\'ll be back???YOUR SO SWEET! Well to fill you in on where I\'ve been...On a whim we packed up and moved 2,000 miles away to Arizona!!All on the hopes &amp; dreams of finally becoming official home owners.So, needless to say I\'ve been a little bit busy.When and if life ever settles down, I\'ll be back!

We\'ll if you\'ve been in any department store lately, you\'ve seen all the cute summer clothes being replaced with winter. I guess seeing how we\'ve officially had NO summer with all this rain, we might as well start getting ready for fall/winter.In doing so you have to check out these ADORABLE boots!...

It\'s going to be like The running of the brides only in a shoe store!   Wondering where I\'ve been? I\'ve been so busy fighting the terrible two\'s
I  didn\'t even know The Man in the Moon was in my queue til I got it, and I can\'t imagine why I would have possibly a,\'ed it. According to Wikipedia, Reese Witherspoon\'s first movie\'is notorious for a glimpse of the actress\'s underage, naked rear end.\'Hah. Anyway, it wasn\'t bad. It really made me want to move to a farm in the South. Reese, who I generally like, plays 14-year-old Dani Trant, who falls in love with an older guy who moves in next door (played by Jason London-the twin from Dazed and Confused and that Aerosmith video, not the one from Mallrats). He falls in love with her older sister, a girl who everyone spends the whole movie talking about how beautiful she is, which is kinda weird cause she has a mustache. There is lots of skinnydipping in the local pond. The dad is played by a guy from Law and Order I think. There is a really creepy scene where the older sister goes to a dance and gets groped by her date\'s father, then by her date. Anyway, eventually Dani finds out that the guy and her sister are sneaking around behind her back, but then Jason London is killed falling off his tractor, and then the sisters forgive each other. It was a pretty decent coming-of-age type movie--the acting was good, and it wasn\'t overly sappy, but it was kind of boring. It has that ubiquitous  teen movie scene where a tomboy type girl gets disgusted when she finds out that you kiss boys with her tongue, and then she practices on her pillow (or in this case, her hand.) At one point,
After finishing this, it occurred to me I had George MacDonald\'s allegorical fairytale Lilith in mind when working on it. George MacDonald was a good friend of Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) . The story is that of a sort of super-succubus who holds half the waters of the world in her hand. Her sin is in cutting off life, which results in her living a sort of half-life and doing harm to others. George MacDonald was quite an interesting character, a Presbyterian minister whose unorthodox sermons (he believed in that God was internal, and in love rather than doctrine) got his parishioners riled up to the point where he was essentially demoted from a parish with a good living to a less remunerative one. It\'s also interesting that C.S. Lewis was such an admirer of MacDonald, whose vision seems to me much more generous than that of Lewis.This (on Imaginary Bicycle) made me cry, in a good way.
I wrote this one in 30 minutes last night. Isn\'t it nice when the right guy gives you the right sort of inspiration? I was tempted to use his name, but alas, I thought I\'d leave a little mystery this time around... I like the way you look me in the eyes I, I like the way you always make me smile And oh, you know I love the way that, if only for awhile, you make me feel like the only girl in the room Guess I never saw myself until I saw you It\'s our world, not theirs, baby It\'s our time to live our lives unafraid While the sun shines down on us Don\'t you know you and me, we can be anyone? Right here, right now, there\'s so much beauty in knowing It\'s your hand that\'s going to hold me So, baby, let\'s just let go Into the great wide open We have a lifetime of tomorrows But don\'t you always want to remember the taste of yesterdays? What if I told you our yesterdays were happening right now? If you fall, I\'ll be the one to catch you If you call, I\'ll be the first to rescue you Who says we can\'t jump with our feet still on the ground? It\'s our world, not theirs, baby It\'s our time to live our lives unafraid While the sun shines down on us Don\'t you know you and me, we can be anyone? Right here, right now, there\'s so much beauty in knowing It\'s your hand that\'s going to hold me So, baby, let\'s just let go Into the great wide open And as the days turn into years I\'ll still be the one here to catch you Baby, know that I\'ll never forget you... It\'s our world, not theirs, baby It\'s our time to live our lives unafraid While the sun shines down on us Don\'t you know you and me, we can be anyone? Right here, right now, there\'s so much beauty in knowing It\'s your hand that\'s going to hold me So, baby, let\'s just let go Into the great wide open It\'s our world, not theirs, baby It\'s our time to live our lives unafraid While the sun shines down on us Don\'t you know you and me, we can be anyone?

[Photo via Le Love ] TO: Men all over the planet FROM: Melissa RE: Stupid stereotypes DATE: March 16, 2010 So, boys, you know how I\'m always trying to drill those stupid disability misconeptions out of your beautiful minds? Well, stand-up comedian Ryan Niemiller has actually found a better way to do it. His A Guide to Dating for the Handicapped takes the humor route, and I couldn\'t have said it better myself... As someone with a handicap, I have had my fair share of troubles finding love. Luckily, all of my non-handicapped friends have been so kind over the years to help me along the way, and tell me how I, someone with a handicap, should date. I\'ve compiled, in conjunction with Ally\'Wheels\'Bruener, this helpful list for anyone else here that might have a disability! I present... the Guide to Dating for the Handicapped! -Only look for others [people with disabilities]. -Never try to date up. You will fail. -Make yourself look as normal as possible. If someone is stupid enough, they may think you\'re normal. -Never complain about the fact that you don\'t have anybody. You\'re handicapped and supposed to be an inspiration. Don\'t be selfish. -Everyone that hangs out with you is paid to do so. Just accept it. -Don\'t ask for anyone to set you up. No one is going to be that mean to their friends. -If you are disabled, you must be asexual. -If you really want a date, try getting it setup through the Make-A-Wish Foundation. It\'s your best bet. -Just accept the fact that a pat on the head from a little old man will be the most action you\'ll see. -Take some classes on counseling: You\'ll be the one everyone comes to with their problems. -If anyone actually offers to sleep with you, decline. It is a fraternity/sorority initiation prank. Or your parents paid them. -If you don\'t want to die a virgin, begin shopping around for the best-priced hooker immediately. -Never let your quest for a relationship get out to your family: They\'ll reassure that it just isn\'t practical. -Your non-handicapped friends are right - you\'re just being silly. -Society isn\'t as harsh as you think. You\'re just being overly critical. -Every member of the opposite sex you talk to will tell you there is someone out there for you - it\'s just not them. -You just aren\'t trying hard enough. -You\'re trying too hard. Just let it happen. -You want a family? Don\'t these supposed rules society buys into just look completely ridiculous and ignorant when seen on paper (well, on the screen) and listed all together? Don\'t they want to make you scratch your eyes out? Because you know I have a big mouth, allow me to a,\' a couple of my own to round out the list... -Always have your date talk for you, cut your meat for you and tell people to move out of the way as you\'re coming through. Because, you know, you can\'t use your voice in public. Don\'t want to scare the little children, do you? -If the most action you ever get is looking into the gorgeous blue eyes of Silvio every time he comes to help you shower, be grateful. Silvio is your in-home health-care worker. -You\'re loved by your family. That\'s more than what some people have. Don\'t cry with a loaf of bread under your arm. Let me know, boys, when those guilty, oh-my-gosh-I-can\'t-believe-I-let-her-get-away feelings set in. Go ahead, boys. I\'ll wait. Heck, I\'ve got all day - and night...you know, because it\'s not like I have a date or anything. xoxo [Photos via happythings ] I love the meaning behind these travel-themed engagement photo shoots. These couples look so happy and excited to be starting a new adventure in marriage, don\'t they? xoxo P.S. The Map Shoot is my favorite! Too bad there\'s not really a Map of Love somewhere out there! And the Plane Shoot makes me want to burst into my own rendition of Up Where We Belong . Sigh. P.P.S. Check out Beau-Coup\'s We,\'ing Blog for more awww-inspiring couples! The wonderfully insightful Kasey is back to share more tales with us this week (read his previous tales here + here ). And just so you know readers, these are in no way solicited by me, but I will say I\'m loving his style, aren\'t you? xoxo Rule #11 Put your money where your mouth is. Guys, if you like a girl, you need either to pay or offer to pay for the evening. Period. Ladies, if you like a guy and you\'ve been on a few dates, (and you\'re not going to dump him), offer to pay every now and then. I typically refuse to let girls pay if I like them. But I love it when they ask. And if the ladies want to pay for their own, that is fine too. If a guy does not offer to pay, it is usually safe to assume that he isn\'t that into you. If a girl wants to pay her own way, guys, let her. Actually, guys, let her do whatever she wants. Don\'t screw it up. But AT LEAST OFFER to pay. You are not trying to buy your date, or buy sex, or any of those ludicrous ideas. You are simply saying, \'I like you,\' and proving it by how you handle your money. Rule #22 Always call with a plan. Recently, a girl friend of mine received a call (from a guy who supposedly likes her) where his only question was, \'Can I call you tomorrow to see when you\'re free?\' Let this sink in. Read it again.... Exactly. Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb. He had her on the phone already...wouldn\'t it make sense to just ask her when she was free? Yes. People are actually this silly. Anyway, the point is, always call with a plan. Even if the plan is just to talk about the other person\'s day. That counts, because you\'re talking, building communication skills, and (hopefully) getting to know more about the other person\'s likes and dislikes (so you can pull out that information when it really counts). Guys, unless it is too late to go do something, you always need to have a plan that puts the two of you together. Suggestions include movies, dinner, walks in the park, heck, you can even walk around Wal-mart and do some grocery shopping! I like asking girls if they would like to play with my Wii. O,\'ly enough, they like it!!! :) It is OK if the girl wants to change the plan. Just make sure you have thought of something. Especially avoid this exchange: \'What do you want to do?\' \'I don\'t know, what do you want to do?\' \'I don\'t know...maybe...well....what do you want to do?\' NO, NO, NO! If all else fails, say, \'I want to see you!!\' That, at least, is the truth. [Photos via We Heart It ] Prologue : You know your nonexistent love life has become close to extinction territory when your own mother makes you feel as though it\'s the most ludicrioous idea in the world that you could possibly be interested in or even have a chance with a romantic beau. I had another one of those invisibility moments last week. You know the kind, friends...where you\'re just standing there and wishing you had a white flag that you could wave wildly in the air and scream,\'HELLO, I\'m right here, aren\'t I? Why can\'t you see me? And yet, even though I was there, I felt completely invisible. And what made me feel even worse was that the person whom I felt invisible toward wasn\'t some guy or some guy\'s girlfriend or even Mr. Hefner himself. It was my mother. Here\'s how the situation went down: I got a sweet email from Cute Guy Friend on the anniversary of my dad\'s death last week. He wrote to say that he was thinking of my family and remembering my dad. How sweet is that? Well, as my awkward (and awful...) luck would have it, things turned pretty sour, pretty quickly when I casually brought it up to my mother later that day.\'Oh, that\'s sweet,\'she replied, and then immediately turned to my sister and sai,\'dYou should date him...\'My sister? Really? I mean...really? I just sat there floored, and quite a bit deflated. A few minutes later, during which time my mother had probably forgotten what she\'d said in the first place, I said flat-out,\'Why didn\'t you say that to me?\'You\'ve never expressed an interest in him,\'she replied, as if my question was the dumbest thing she\'d ever heard. NEWSFLASH: Neither has my sister. She\'s never expressed an interest in him. Not even once. So let\'s review the facts, shall we, friends? -He emailed me -My sister hardly knows him I suppose it bothered me even more because this isn\'t the first time my mother has bypassed me completely, which is why I\'ve always looked at my sister as the pretty one. I know, it\'s being overly sensitive probably on my part, and my mother probably wasn\'t even thinking about my disability when she made that remark. In the last few months, I\'ve been feeling increasingly confident as a sexy woman with a disability ( OK, gosh, just typing the word sexy to describe myself just made me blush, literally... ), and I suppose this harmless comment brought some of those invisibility, wallflower feelings back. Even if just a little bit, you know? Is it impossible for my mother - or anyone, really - to think that I could be capable of being in a relationship? Has that concept just never even dawned on her? Am I not worthy of that just as much as anyone else? I know she doesn\'t do it consciously, but sometimes, I swear my mother is incapable of seeing me as a woman, and yes, I\'m aware that this is a common theme among mothers. But it just seems so much more pronounced in my life, especially when you a,\' the disability factor to it. Or maybe, at the end of the day, I\'m just being overly sensitive. Maybe I\'m projecting my own insecurities and using them as a lens by which to judge things. Let\'s be honest, friends: It\'s not like I haven\'t done that sort of thing before. But you know what, damnit? It bothered me. It hurt me. It eroded just a little of the disability self-esteem that had been slowly growing like a flower. Well, now the flower looks as if it\'s beginning to wilt. What do you think, friends? Am I just being overly neurotic once again? xoxo [Photos via happythings ] Routines...my gosh, they can be hard to get back into, can\'t they, friends? I\'m back at work today and am trying to get back into the swing of things. May these calming photos inspire me - and you! xoxo [Photos via flickr ] Happy Monday, friends! I was going over the Man Candy archives over the weekend, and I had to gasp when I realized I haven\'t featured this guy yet. Well, he\'s more of a man than a guy, and let\'s just say that he\'s only gotten better with age. He showed us a new life of living on a prayer and always promised to lay us down in a bed of roses. And as she\'s aged, he\'s up the sexy-wow factor by declaring\'it\'s my life\'and reminding us that, yes, we can go home again... JON BON JOVI!!!!!!!!!! Happy Friday, friends! How was your week? My spring break was entirely too short (as always!), but I\'m looking forward to returning to work on Monday and get back into some semblance of a routine.

Longtime FSP readers know that I am interested in how academia is depicted in literature and other artistic venues, and that I have a particular interest in academic satire in novels . Although I generally disapprove of attempts to make academia and academics seem like bizarre, megalomaniacal control freaks who are entirely disconnected from the\'real\'world, I am not incapable of enjoying a good academic satire (hence my fondness of the novel Straight Man , by Richard Russo). I even like the Indigo Girls\' song,\'Closer to Fine\', despite this horrific set of anti-academic lyrics: I went to see the doctor of philosophy With a poster of Rasputin and a beard down to his knee. He never did marry, or see a B-grade movie He graded my performance He said he could see through me. I spent four years prostrate to the higher mind, got my paper And I was free. Give me a break. Anyway, I was curious to read the recent novel\'36 Arguments for the Existence of God\'( Rebecca Goldstein ), described in some reviews as a brilliant new example in the academic satire genre. Washington Post (Ron Charles): The field of academic satire is crowded with such classics as\'Lucky Jim\'and\'Straight Man,\'but\'36 Arguments\'sports so many spot-on episodes of cerebral pomposity that you\'ve got to place this novel among the very funniest ever written. New York Times (Janet Maslin ): When Cass witnesses a PowerPoint presentation featuring \'brain scans of sophomores, neuroimaged in the throes of moral deliberation over whether they should, in theory, toss a hapless fat man onto the tracks in order to use his bulk to save five other men from an oncoming trolley,\' this book occupies its ideal vantage point: close to the absurdity of current academic thinking yet just far enough away to laugh. Cerebral pomposity? The absurdity of current academic thinking? Did these reviewers also spend their college years prostrate to bearded, Rasputin-loving higher minds? Certainly there are pompous intellectuals in academia, and some research topics and methods seem quite absurd , but these are not the kinds of things I enjoy seeing parodied in novels and pilloried in reviews. For me, the most clever and entertaining academic novels are the ones that show the absurdity of the weird-but- mundane rituals of academic life (professor-student interactions, faculty meetings, budgets, tenure) and that are a bit more subtle in their portrayal of classic personalities in academe. Therefore, I am not particularly impressed by bizarre and disturbing characters such as the\'Extreme Distinguished Professor\'in 36 Arguments , and am much more entertained by a depiction of strangely recognizable people embroiled in the bizarre and disturbing rituals of a faculty search (as in Straight Man ). Said FSP\'s daughter\'s mi,\'le school Science teacher to FSP when he saw her in the corridor of the school: Hey, it\'s the famous woman scientist. I was taken aback at first, wondering why he used adjectives, one of which was strange and the other implied that scientist = man unless you specify otherwise (hence the somewhat cynical name for this blog). But then I figured out why he greeted me that way. Later, this same science teacher asked me if I would come talk to his class in a month or two. Great! I replied. But I thought you were done with the unit on My Science. Oh.. ah.. yes. Actually, we are doing a unit on Diversity and so we need a .. a .. a.. Woman scientist? Yes, exactly. The state expects us to do something on Diversity and I uh.. uh.. have no clue what to do and don\'t even know enough to ask this favor in a non-offensive way? I didn\'t say that, but, actually, I don\'t have a clue either. I have never talked about Diversity to a group of mi,\'le school kids before. I assume that I should talk about all types of diversity, not gender. I would like to keep my overall message positive and talk about Science as a rewarding career, but perhaps we could also discuss stereotypes of scientists (strange white males). I\'m going to have to give this a lot more thought. Has anyone else given a talk on Diversity to mi,\'le schoolers? I could use some advice. As both a student and a professor, I have experienced at various times both the US quarter and semester systems. For those unfamiliar with these systems: An academic year composed of quarters involves 3 academic terms (+ a summer term = 4 quarters), each of 10 weeks duration (fall, winter, spring). An academic year composed of semesters involves 2 terms, each ~15 (±) weeks duration (fall and\'spring\', the former of which may include the end of summer and the latter of which includes the winter season). Some of my colleagues and students experience the\'block plan\'(1 intensive course per 3 week period), but I have not, so I will confine my comments to quarters v. semesters. Both quarter and semester systems have advantages and disadvantages for professors and students, but these pros and cons may shift around from course to course depending on various factors related to course content and professorial teaching ability. Quarter system: Terms are shorter. Boring classes are over sooner, and boring professors can inflict less damage. The content and format of some courses, even very enthralling ones, are better suited to a shorter term. Quarters typically start later (September in the US) and end later (June) than the semester-based academic year. You may like or dislike quarters owing to this feature; alternatively, you may like this feature in late August and early September (when your semester colleagues have started their academic year) and hate it in May and early June (when your semester colleagues already have their grades done). It may be easier for professor to get a research leave for a quarter than it is to get a semester leave. Students on the quarter system may be at a disadvantage in the summer because their academic year ends late relative to the start of some summer internships and other jobs. Semester system : Semesters can seem very, very long. Your joy at making it to Spring Break may be a bit dampened by the realization that the semester is only half over. You can, however, explore more topics in more depth than you can with a shorter term. You may have more flexibility in course content, owing to the longer term. You get to know your students better. You might even learn all their names. You may start the academic year before you are ready for summer to end, but you are done in the spring. Depending on your institutions policies re. teaching load, you may have fewer course preps/year. You only have to deal with beginning and end of semester craziness twice instead of 3 times. In an academic term, the first couple of weeks and the last week or two can be quite chaotic, but in a semester, there is plenty of time in the mi,\'le to get into a routine in which the logistics of the course are at least functioning well. As a student, I didn\'t have a strong preference, even once I had experienced both systems. Depending on how many courses I was expected to take at once and what the course offerings were, I may have had a slight preference for one over the other, but overall it didn\'t matter a lot to me. As a professor, I think I prefer the quarter system, recognizing that semesters do have some distinct advantages. For most courses, I feel that I can convey the most essential information in 10 weeks. I wouldn\'t like quarters if I had to create new courses all the time, but for a relatively stable set of courses and only the occasional new course to prepare, quarters are better for maintaining a high energy level and morale from term start to term end. Which do you like? Semesters or quarters or something else? Some applications for open faculty positions require letters of recommendation up-front; some request letters only after there has been a first stage of selection based on other information supplied by the applicant. Although I don\'t mind the first method, I prefer the second because it seems like a better use of time for those writing the letters and for those reading the applications. I know that things are done in a different way at many non-US institutions, but lately I have encountered variations on this system within the US. In the past few months: - I received a request for a letter of reference for someone who had already been invited to interview at a US institution. In fact, no letters of reference were solicited until this stage, so my letter wasn\'t supplementary or an attempt to fill a reference letter quota. The letters were clearly not a part of the interview selection decision. It is unclear what role, if any, they have in the search. and - I received a request for a letter of reference after someone had a phone interview but before they were invited for the actual interview . I am glad I am not on that hiring committee, as it seems to involve several extra steps. I didn\'t mind either of those requests, although the first case made me wonder why the institution even bothered to get letters if they are so unimportant in the process. Perhaps it is an administrative requirement? Having read thousands of these letters, I must say I can\'t really blame anyone for not valuing reference letters very much. A letter request that did annoy me, however, was one accompanied by the information that my letter would not even be read unless the candidate advanced to the final interview stage. In this case, the position is not an academic one, so perhaps I just lack familiarity with how things are done outside academia. From what I could tell from the instructions, the organization will not read the letters before the final candidates are selected from a huge pool of applicants but wants to have the letters on hand to read as soon as the final interviewees are selected, and hence the request for possibly superfluous letters. I can understand the wish for efficiency, especially given the large number of applicants, but it is a bit of a strange request: Please write this letter even though we are unlikely to read it. We need to be efficient but we are willing to (possibly) waste your time. Wouldn\'t such a request lend itself to getting cursory letters or letters that are not focused specifically on the position for which the applicant has applied? I typically take some time to customize each letter depending on what the position is, and in some cases this takes quite a bit of time. Why would I do that if I don\'t know if my letter will even be read? I guess I will do it for the same reason we write any reference letters, not knowing if the subject of the letters will get the position. Despite knowing in this particular case that my letter may be transferred, unread, directly to an electronic trash heap, I think the best strategy is to try to forget about that and write the letter in the hopes that it will eventually be read, the student will get the job, and it will all be worthwhile in the end. A reader asks: How long do you typically give 1st or 2nd year grad students to\'pull things together\'when they struggle in the beginning? Where is the line is drawn and what factors affect the judgments professors will make about their students? I will consider only PhD students in this discussion. I should say right away that I do not have a foolproof way of deciding when or where to draw the line on struggling students. I tend to err on the side of delusional optimism, hoping that some solution involving change in project (topics, methods), degree of supervision (more structure, specific goal-setting), or approach to writing will pull us all through the problems. Only in hindsight has it been obvious when this was a bad plan, resulting in prolonged suffering and expense. In other cases, it has worked; by\'worked\'I mean that the student got their PhD and therefore any difficulties were worth it, I think. That said, when and where I draw the line depends on the specific things with which the student is struggling and how (or whether) they are making an effort to communicate about and/or deal with the problem(s). Is the problem motivation? If a student is unproductive owing to a severe lack of interest or motivation in any reasonable research project they can do with me as adviser, that is something that should be quite clear in the second year, if not the first. (though I have had students who started out very energetic in the first year but whose motivation was completely extinguished in the second by the reality of what research and/or working with me involves) Is the problem that the student lacks the information or skills necessary to do the research? That can be fixed in many cases, and should be dealt with by the end of the second year. The student should be as proactive as possible about learning what they need to know to do their research. Is the problem the adviser? Is this something that could be fixed by discussing the situation or is it something that can\'t be changed? If the latter, the student has a decision to make about whether to continue with that adviser. Although it is possible that, with time, the student may understand better what seems like irrational or unkind behavior, it is likely that the adviser won\'t become more sane or nice with time. Is the problem beyond the student\'s control? Examples: Access to facilities? A complex and difficult research project that may proceed in a non-linear way? Lack of clear direction? Research that takes a long time to produce interpretable results? I am impressed by students who find ways to deal with obstacles like these. In fact, a student who feels like they are struggling, perhaps because they are too critical when comparing themselves with others, may not be struggling in the eyes of the adviser and other faculty. Other problems, such as those involving finishing a project or writing, may not manifest themselves until later (after the first two years). In the first two years, it is not too late to change course in a possibly dramatic way, including deciding that there is no point in continuing in the graduate program. There have been a few cases in which I decided in the first or second year that there was no point in advising a student for a PhD; these students got an MS instead. There has to be an obvious, major reason for going this route, though -- e.g., failed classes or lack of productivity owing to extreme lack of effort. Will a student who has a slow (but not catastrophic) first year or two be at a permanent disadvantage? I suppose this depends on the adviser, but in my opinion, a student who struggles with something in the first year or two, but who eventually surmounts the obstacles and succeeds, should not be at a disadvantage later. In fact, few arrive in graduate school perfectly prepared to leap into the perfect project that goes perfectly from Day One. If you had asked any of my graduate advisers or committee members what they thought of me in my first or second years of graduate school, the responses would have ranged from a derisive snort to a polite but sympathetic chuckle at my likely future career as a cat sitter. That changed a few years later once I started getting results and writing papers, and my slow start didn\'t harm my career. If you (mostly) like what you are doing, and at times possibly even love what you are doing, and you want to keep going with your research, despite initial problems, my advice, summarized, is: Stay focused, know what your goals are (short-range, intermediate-range, long-range), communicate with your adviser and others, if you feel stuck at least make some progress step-by-step (even if the steps seem small), and don\'t worry so much. The Chronicle Review (the magazine-like part of The Chronicle of Higher Education ) recently asked a group of\'scholars and experts\'to comment on stress in the lives of academics, using the Amy Bishop incident as a springboard for the discussion; i.e., what role might stress related to the tenure process have played in this tragedy? The scholars and experts included: a writer and PhD candidate in English literature the chancellor of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education a professor of international politics a professor of English an assistant professor of public policy and political science an assistant professor of sociology and women\'s and gender studies a PhD candidate in anthropology a dean of a School of Arts &amp; Sciences a professor of management a professor of history Clearly there was an effort to consult a wide variety of academics associated with the US system of higher education: professors and administrators, tenured professors and tenure-track professors, professors at universities and professors at small liberal arts colleges, even some PhD candidates who have no direct experience (yet) with the stresses of being on the tenure-track. Many of these people had thoughtful insights; I was interested to know the opinions of sociologists and anthropologists and others. Even so, Amy Bishop was an assistant professor of biology. Does it seem o,\' to anyone else that there were no biology or other science professors in this particular group of academics commenting on the incident? I looked up the chancellor and the dean and learned that their field of expertise is psychology, so perhaps they come the closest, but that\'s not the same as getting the opinion of someone who has recently experienced the tenure process as a scientist. I realize that a biology professor would not necessarily have any more insight into the general implications of the incident than those who provided comments in this piece in the Chronicle . And I still stand by my overall view (shared by the PhD candidate in English literature) that the murders were the actions of an imbalanced person with a rage problem (and a gun), and the tragedy was therefore not a direct result of the stresses of academia in general or the tenure evaluation system in particular. Still, I think it is strange that in an otherwise diverse group, not one is a science professor with direct knowledge of what it is like to get tenure as a scientist today at a university. Consider how bizarre it would have been if an English professor (for example) had committed a heinous crime that may or may not have been related to the experience of being an English professor, and the only people asked to comment (in a particular series of essays) were science, engineering, and math professors. I also think it would have been illuminating to read, for comparison, the thoughts of a scientist recently denied tenure. With all due respect to the PhD candidates and literary scholars who wrote thoughtful essays for the piece, surely the Chronicle could have found some current or former science professors -- ideally in the life sciences -- to comment? I don\'t want to perpetuate an\'us\'(scientists) vs.\'them (non-scientists) mentality, but often when I read about academia, in the Chronicle and elsewhere, the point of view of non-scientists is the only one represented. This gives a very incomplete view of academia and the lives of academics, in general and in extreme cases. Although we have much in common as researchers and educators, there are also significant differences that, at times, merit consideration. Who is staying away from campus for Spring Break by choice (i.e., not owing to a furlough)? Who is doing this because otherwise they will have a dire childcare challenge? Who is staying away from campus for a week as a sanity break so that they can face the rest of the academic year with renewed energy? Of those avoiding campus: Will you be going somewhere (preferably fun and interesting) or just staying home (and possibly working there)? Who will be on campus but would rather not be there? Who will be on campus because if they don\'t, they fear the consequences (from their adviser, from their advisees , from a promotion &amp; tenure committee, from collaborators)? If you are a graduate student, has your adviser specifically discussed with you whether you can/should/will work over Spring Break? If so, what did they say? If not, what do you think they would say? And who is going to be on campus because they want to be there -- to enjoy a week of relative quiet in their office, catch up on research, get ready for post-break classes, and possibly even clean their desk and its immediate surroundings?

(grad students) off campus but working off campus and not working on campus and working (but would rather not be) on campus and working (happily!) pollcode .com free polls Many times I have conversed with a visitor who is much more famous and smarter than I am. We sit in my office and we/I try to find something of mutual interest that we can discuss. I am not a skilled conversationalist, but I can almost always find something to talk about for half an hour. One of the things I am not tempted to discuss is the disparity in success or fame or IQ or amount of funding of whatever between the visitor and me. What would be the point of that? It is therefore disconcerting for me when I find myself in the visitor\'s chair in someone else\'s office and they start the conversation with a series of self-deprecating statements about how they have not published as much as I have, and how I write better proposals than they do, and how they are basically not as successful as I am. This does not happen often, but it happens from time to time. I hasten to note that this is not because I am so awesomely famous or well funded. My usual description of myself is\'reasonably successful\'as a scientist, and I think that is accurate. I do not think the self-deprecation is a form of false modesty. The self-deprecating person is genuinely ripped up about their lack of productivity. I think these conversations stem more from insecurities than from anything specific about me or my career. Even so, what I am supposed to say when confronted with these types of statements? I am more than willing to have a conversation about proposal strategies or ideas for new directions in research, or even to have a group wallow about some aspect of Science or Academia that is particularly controversial or nerve-wracking. If the self-deprecating person is a stressed out early career professor, I can go into mentor mode, if that seems to be a useful way to go. Otherwise, I try to steer the conversations to research-related topics that might be of mutual interest, or I ask a lot of questions. It is possible that some\'successful\'visitors will want to tell you how amazing they (think they) are, but in the absence of such a conversational foray, here is a gentle request to those scheduled for an individual meeting with a visiting speaker: Even if you feel that you are orders of magnitude less successful than your visitor in some professional capacity, even if you have the most raging case of impostor syndrome, even if you are in awe of the towering intellect of your distinguished visitor, and even if you can think of nothing more fabulous than being a short, unprepossessing mi,\'le-aged female science professor like your visitor, please tuck away these feelings and talk about Science or Students or Something else other than your (relative) lack of success. Some visitor\'s egos may need continual care and stoking, but I think you will feel better, and everyone will have a more interesting half hour, if self-deprecation, whatever the reason for it, is not a major feature of the conversation.

Ivor Reveley (check out the \'Gotta Run\' t-shirt) On whether he has done such a thing before  Two years ago, on his fiftieth birthday, Ivor and a team of runners ran from Romford to Orpington.&#160; They ran 50kms over 50 hours to raise money for 50 young people with autism.&#160; Ivor broke that down for me and explained that it is not as impossible as it sounds (bearing in mind that I walk a 5km fun run once a year): you run for two to three hours a day over three days and cover about 20 kilometres a day.&#160; It is not easy but it is possible! They raised £8,500 on that occasion which meant that their charity CASPA was able to obtain viability and get the real start that it required.&#160; This is so important, as Ivor explains, because it meant that the charity could remain a stable entity in the lives of the children and families it serves. On why he was raising money for CASPA? Ivor\'s sixteen-year-old son has autism.&#160; After being a charity trustee for fifteen to twenty years, Ivor realised that he had the skill necessary to make a difference in the lives of other children with autism and he decided to get involved with CASPA. On what CASPA is and what they do... Ivor is the chair and trustee of the charity.&#160; They started off as an informal parents\' association in 2002 and formally registered the charity in 2005.&#160; As a charity, they run events and workshops for young people with autism such as: Brighton Beach kid\'s days out Youth Club on a Friday night A residential week long summer camp Independent Living Workshops (which are sponsored by the LDA ) They have received brilliant feedback from the children who say it is a safe environment for them to have fun, free from bullying or other such concerns. On making the runs interesting  After completing A-levels in Economics, Geography and Maths, Ivor went on to study Economics at university. An avid map lover, Ivor is now using his Geography and Maths skills again as he plans the most historical and geographically interesting routes through cathedrals and up high streets.&#160; The idea is for the runners to enjoy these events and to see and learn about the places they run through. On this year\'s event  Date: 30 April   3 May 2010. Route: Clapham Common to Brighton Beach ( route details ) Ivor hopes to do events like this every even year and this year they will be doing a four day run from Clapham to Brighton.&#160; Ivor is keeping a log of all of the training and organising of the event in his blog Four Days Running . A half marathon is 21km and these runners will be doing more than that each day as they will run from about 2.30pm to 5pm every day for four days. Friends, family and supporters will be able to meet up with the runners every evening as pub nights are being organised on Facebook and the hotels that the group is staying in is published on the site ( stay on route ). This is not a public run but anyone interested in joining the run can contact Ivor at the site to get involved.&#160; They have a photographer taking part this year so expect great photos! On how YOU can help  You can donate money using the button above.&#160; That will take you to the Just Giving site where the money will go straight to the charity and won\'t touch anyone\'s hands. But don\'t worry, there are lots of other ways to help too: Follow the Four Days Running blog Follow Ivor\'s Twitter account: @revivor .&#160; Join the fun and do the four day run: Run With Us Stay on the route and be a supporter If you are reading this anywhere besides Emm in London or in an RSS reader then the content is stolen.

Barely a day goes by when we don\'t hear of someone\'s tales of woe with regards to their finances. Maybe nary a day goes by when you don\'t think of your OWN tales of personal finance horror, but this post isn\'t about personal finances, in fact, this post isn\'t even going to be particularly serious in the slightest, perhaps a welcome break from the drudgery we encounter on a day-to-day basis. This post is for those who dare to dream, who occasionally   or often, there\'s no discrimination at play here   have flights of fancy where they can afford whatever they please, consequences be damned. Food. Everyone loves food. Of course, there are picky eaters, gluttons who eat anything and then there\'s the gourmet, who will indulge in only the finest of fripperies wherever food is concerned. You\'ve probably guessed where this is going and it\'s headed in a direction in which the subject matter will revolve around the finest/most expensive eating establishments in Britain, avoiding the clichÈ that is the \'world\'s most expensive\' and instead opting for the lower-key \'just in Britain\' subtitle, so maybe you\'ll want to bear these in mind next time you\'re booking any flights to London . There are no diamonds in food, gemstones on cutlery-related shenanigans here, for these places are expensive because well they just ARE. London, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay Also one of the single most expensive restaurants in the world, this place can set you back at least £120 for a single person and that\'s just selecting from the average stuff. If you were to opt for more exquisite dishes and then a bottle or wine or so, well, then you\'re looking at a hefty price-tag indeed! A favorite amongst locals and tourists alike (provided that can afford it, of course), the restaurant itself is known for serving up the most palate-pleasing dishes in the whole of England\'s fine capital city. Typical delights on offer might include Cornish lamb, pork belly and the finest Angus beef, all mixed in with a wide range of other fine accoutrements. By the time you were done with this place, you\'d certainly be in a better position to understand the reason behind the three Michelin Stars that have been awarded to it. However, your wallet might not be! Berkshire, Waterside Inn Put on the proverbial map thanks to fantastic food, a three-star Michelin chef in the form of owner Michel Roux and a £24 plum soufflÈ that made it onto the Forbes list of the world\'s most expensive desserts (it came tenth), the Waterside Inn is not only a dive into opulence, but also a dive into quality as those stars aren\'t awards to just anyone that comes along. With \'Inn\' in the title, you\'d be correct in suspecting that the building housing the restaurant also serves as a place where you can   for a modest sum   spend a few nights. The restaurant\'s chefs serve the whole gamut of dishes you\'d expect: lobster, rabbit, lamb, duck, turbot and many others, each served as decadently and in an adept a fashion as you\'d imagine. Truly an experience for the rich in taste as well as the rich in wealth, as you will most likely be set back around £100+ for a two-course meal. London, Sketch Back to the nation\'s capital again, for meals that again breach the £100 mark. Sketch has long been touted as an incredibly expensive place to eat, hence the gaggle of celebrities and other people of note that occasionally dine at the establishment. However, the price doesn\'t belie the quality and instead is more of an indication of it, what with the restaurant itself being a product of Algerian restaurateur Mourad Mazouz and celebrated French chef Pierre Gagnaire, you can rest assured that the place will contain nothing less than the most sumptuous of everything the culinary realm has to offer.

Please report stolen content to missus.emm@gmail.com Copyright 2008-2009 Missus Emm http://missus-emm.blogspot.com 3mm154m2ndy On Tuesday night, we went to see the Garrick Theatre production of Douglas Carter Beane\'s The Little Dog Laughed. The Little Dog Laughed is about a rising Hollywood star Mitchell (Rupert Friend) who in the words of his agent \'suffers from a slight recurring case of homosexuality\'.&#160; He meets rent boy Alex (Harry Lloyd) and their lives are turned somewhat upside down when they both fall for each other despite both asserting that they are not gay.&#160; The play is set against the backdrop of Hollywood and homosexuality and explores all of the double standards and difficulties with coming out in show business.&#160; There is a fantastic quote by Colin Firth in the programme which just about sums it up: \'If you\'re a straight actor who takes on the role of a gay man, it\'s obviously not the same as being one in this business\'. The Little Dog Laughed was written by Douglas Carter Beane who also wrote To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar , a 1995 film starring Patrick Swayze and Wesley Snapes.&#160; It first opened off-Broadway at the Second Stage Theatre in 2006.&#160; The play is narrated by Mitchell\'s morally challenged agent Diane (played by Tamsin Greig) who has such classic lines as &quot;A writer with the final cut? I\'d rather give firearms to small children\'.&#160; It is no secret really that I am a massive fan of Harry Lloyd and have spent the past three years watching each and every one of his plays but it is Greig who absolutely steals the show and her acting, wardrobe and personality all fit the role perfectly.&#160; In her role as Diane, Greig superbly breaks through the fourth wall, allowing the audience into the world of Hollywood agents, actors and writers and she did it very well indeed.&#160; She was incredibly comfortable chatting and winking to the audience one minute and then diving right back into her encounters with the rest of the cast the next. Rupert Friend plays the drunken, privileged and somewhat sheltered Mitchell really well.&#160; While I tend not to question how characters were written (as it is generally a fixed factor when putting on a play), I have to wonder at a rising Hollywood star who doesn\'t get the significance of coming out to the world and the effect that could have on his career.&#160; In the end, his naivetÈ is what trips him up though. In an equal sense, Harry Lloyd\'s Alex just doesn\'t seem to understand the dynamic of his relationship with his girl pal Ellen (played by Gemma Arterton) and the effect that his growing relationship with Mitchell will have on her.&#160; He does, however, utter my favourite line of the play while trying to get a point across to Mitchell: \'God, talking to you is like sewing a button on cottage cheese\'. As far as rather shallow, clueless roles go, Friend and Lloyd do as well as they can do but they have both taken on much better roles in the past.&#160; The one thing they do both handle extremely well is the intimacy and affection that develops between their two characters.&#160; There is a fair bit of nudity in the play (with Harry Lloyd being fully nude at one point) and both actors were professional and convincing in their roles. Gemma Arterton was far less convincing and you got the idea that she was trying to inflate her supporting role somewhat as the character definitely shrinks in comparison to the other three.&#160; She seemed to posture a lot and to shout her lines rather than speak them with meaning and emotion.&#160; She is quite inexperienced in theatre though and this certainly didn\'t ruin the play.&#160; You have to wonder though if those in casting didn\'t foresee that she would be completely overshadowed by Greig (or perhaps that was the point?) This production of The Little Dog Laughed was directed by Jamie Lloyd and I must say he made good use of the space and actors.&#160; There is one invisible character, so to speak, who appears in one scene and speaks on the phone but is not played by anyone.&#160; I thought this was really well portrayed by the cast and well managed by the director. The set was designed by Soutra Gilmour who received an Olivier Award nomination for Best Set Design in 2009.&#160; While Gilmour\'s sets are often dark and almost sinister, this was stark, bare and completely white but the minimalist set worked in this play.&#160; The play itself is incredibly funny and highly entertaining.&#160; It doesn\'t provide any grand answers to the problems it identifies but seems to focus more on the situation at hand and how that plays out.&#160; The audience was laughing along raucously at the numerous one-liners and there was much enthusiastic clapping and cheers of \'bravo!\' at the end.&#160; All in all it was a fun night out and I\'d certainly recommend the play for people seeking a light-hearted comedy experience. The Little Dog Laughed is playing at the Garrick Theatre until 10 April 2010.&#160; There are really good prices available on tickets at LastMinute.com and we got tickets for £29.50 each from WestEndTheatre.com .

The Drums The Drums are a post-punk band hailing from Brooklyn, New York and it is likely that you would recognise their song \'Let\'s Go Surfing\'.&#160; They are currently on a sold out tour of UK, Ireland and mainland Europe and will be supporting Florence and the Machine on their nationwide tour starting in May. The Drums have a sound reminiscent of the punk and ska bands of the early eighties but I found them to be pretty average and unoriginal. I had not even heard of them before the night but certainly won\'t be rushing off to buy any of their albums.&#160; Most importantly, I have never seen a bunch of people look so uncomfortable on a stage before.&#160; I\'ve seen cheesy robotic dancing before and singers playing air drums but it is clear that The Drums have a long way to go as a band before they make that look cool. &#160; The Big Pink The Big Pink are the reason we went to the Shockwaves NME Awards Tour this year and it is safe to say that I am a massive fan of their album A Brief History of Love which I reviewed on BlogCritics in January.&#160; The Big Pink arrived on stage with lights and explosions and their whole set was energetic, frenetic and loud.&#160; Their songs were much heavier than they had sounded on their CD and it was a manic mash up of squealing guitars and noise. I imagine that this signals a heavier direction for their new album but it could also be overcompensation for the fact that most of their music is pre-recorded and sampled.&#160; That meant that vocalist Robbie Furze was screaming his vocals and grinding his guitar while we debated amongst ourselves whether the bassist and drummer weren\'t in fact miming.&#160; I am always happy for indie alternative bands to take on a heavier, louder sound; in fact, the noisier the better as far as I am concerned.&#160; But this was not a great performance.&#160; I\'ve seen many bands that use heavy sampling including The Prodigy, Dan le Sac vs Scroobius Pip and Faithless and it is so difficult to put on a great show in front of a massive audience when the majority of your band members are doing little on the actual night but miming.&#160; The Big Pink didn\'t really get it right on Saturday night. Bombay Bicycle Club Bombay Bicycle Club hail from north London and took their name from a string of curry restaurants in the area.&#160; I have no idea what I expected from them before I heard them play on Saturday night as I had barely even heard of them but wasn\'t in the least bit interested in listening to any of their music. I certainly didn\'t expect to have them rock my socks off.&#160; Seconds into their first song, I found myself debating whether to rush off to the shops the next day or order their album through Amazon.&#160; Thankfully, such debates were soon put out of my mind as I got caught up in their energetic, enthusiastic set.&#160; The one thing they did prove was that the problems with the previous two acts weren\'t down to bad acoustics in the venue because their whole sound and lights show was fabulous.&#160; Jack Steadman has a fantastically unique voice and the band are confident and exciting on stage.&#160; Oh, and they can dance.&#160; Perhaps the guys from The Drum need to take some dancing lessons from them.&#160; The crowd went mad for them and I would have to say that Bombay Bicycle Club were the best band of the night.&#160; It is not often that I am won over to unknown bands during a live performance but they were that good. The Maccabees The Maccabees played a massive fifteen song set on Saturday night and gave one of the most impressive live performances I have seen in years.&#160; The Maccabees are from south London but are currently based in London.&#160; They have five full time members but their incredible show included three musicians on brass instruments and at one stage Edwyn Collins joined them to sing \'Rip It Up\'.&#160; The Maccabees use the whole stage and everything from their backdrop to their set up and lighting is absolutely professional and first class.&#160; I honestly found myself widening my eyes to try drink everything in.&#160; Like with Bombay Bicycle Club, the sound was perfect and the crowd went absolutely mad for The Maccabees.&#160; They didn\'t quite have the impact on me that Bombay Bicycle Club did but that is not to say that they weren\'t brilliant.&#160; They were really good and I\'d definitely go see them again sometime. After a rocky start, the ShockWaves NME Awards Tour 2010 was a huge success and Bombay Bicycle Club and The Maccabees certainly made up for a slightly shaky start.&#160; The best thing about the O2 Brixton Academy of course is that after the show, we were able to nip into Nandos for some chicken burgers thus avoiding the British tradition of the post-night out dodgy vindaloo.

I started digging my wallet for the extra quarter and he seemed to sense that I wanted a bag for my lonely little OJ, and I told him that no! I didn\'t need one. I fished out the quarter and laid it on the counter as he handed me the OJ and smiled warmly.As I walked away, I felt filled with an unexpected joy and contentment. In that moment, I felt the city wrap around me for the first time in a while, protectively cu,\'ling me from all sides. I looked around and saw the New York I had first seen in 2004: that energy, that life, that art pulsing through everything. No matter how many chain coffee houses there are, or how much money gets poured into meaningless capitalistic pursuits in this city, there will always be that feeling of endless possibility, that freedom, like if you just believe in it and want it bad enough, you can literally be anything you want. That feeling, that uniquely New York feeling, is something that everyone who ever came to New York to pursue a dream has experienced and can speak to, whether it was in the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, or beyond; and as I walked the block to my office from the coffee cart - which, by the way, was set up right across the street from a Starbucks - I felt it pressing on me in the most comforting way.Despite everything I\'ve been through, and all the uncertainty that continues to face me, I heard the city telling me it\'s going to be OK, and I believed it. I put my hands in the pockets of my trench coat, smiled to myself and walked on.
We are so pleased to announce that our new website is up and running. We are officially moving all of our blog activity to our new www.urbansprouts.org site. Please check it out and bookmark our new page. I recently learned from my students that oxalis, an invasive and aggressive weed for many San Francisco gardeners, is also called sourgrass, whose flower stalk can actually be chewed. Although oxalis has another beneficial function, that is, to prevent soil erosion on slopes, I can\'t help but feel that every time I\'m up at one of my schools, it\'s a renewed battle between oxalis and gardener. Last week, I issued a challenge to my students at Ida B. Wells to pull out as much oxalis as they could from our two main beds, which would be documented as before and after pictures on this blog. Although some students went right to work, others required much more coaxing; many students seem to have an inherent dislike of weeding, even if it\'s just the patch in front of them. At the end of class and after three huge piles of oxalis, it still looked like we barely made a dent in the ratio of oxalis to vegetables. Note to self - next time, to prevent oxalis takeovers, try mulching early before the rains start. Before weeding around the fava beans... After weeding (one student\'s work)... Mulching with straw with my afterschool class... I am very excited to bring to you a glimpse of a day in our gardens. Thanks to our new Flip cameras, you can see Urban Sprouts in action preparing freshly harvested collards into delicious, simple, gourmet snacks! Students at both Martin Luther King mi,\'le school and International Studies Academy have gotten excited about sharing their perspective of the garden to the community and each other. In the near future I hope to use the Flip camera as a medium of communication between the two schools. At Urban Sprouts, we want to connect students to local produce, whether it\'s food from the school garden, persimmons and lemons from someone\'s backyard, or fresh finds from the farmer\'s market. At Aptos Mi,\'le School, the lettuce, arugula, and radish from our school garden were ready to be harvested and tossed into a salad. Students washed, chopped, and combined local fruits and vegetables with a sesame salad dressing and a persimmon vinagrette. Although some students were more interested in the cooking than in the eating, it was a first step towards creating healthy (and colorful) dishes using many local ingredients. A,\'itionally, students at Ida B. Wells Continuation High School learned how to whip up persimmon ice cream using only five ingredients (lemon, vanilla, sugar, buttermilk, and persimmons), and without a fancy ice cream maker. Thank you, Ms. Bressack, for donating the delicious persimmons from your backyard! Help grow the school gardens movement! We are looking for members to join our Outreach Committee. These individuals will work alongside our staff to represent Urban Sprouts at partner school events, community fairs, farmers markets, and other city-wide events.

Pictures from Log Cabin Ranch Last week was a busy week in the gardens as we hosted 3 large group events. Employees and students from Wells Fargo, Haas School of Business, and Blueprint Research &amp; Design performed almost 100 hours of volunteer labor as we built worm bins and compost bins, dug new beds, and completed some general garden work. This was a fantastic start to our new composting initiative as we are on track to build new compost bins, worm bins, and compost sifters in all 7 of our sites in the next few months. 0 false 18 pt 18 pt 0 0 false false false /- Style Definitions -/ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:\'Table Normal\'; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-parent:\'; mso-pa,\'ing-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:\'Times New Roman\'; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:\'Times New Roman\'; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} Thank you so much for your time and energy, it\'s always so great to welcome new folks into the gardens.

thrift shirt and skirt. gap sweatshirt. Pictures I took back when my hair was blonde and there was snow outside and I wasn\'t all lazy and in a style rut like now. Any ideas as to what a story to them could be? I haven\'t the slightest idea. Today in school we played dodgeball. Or, rather, I played dodgeball, and everyone else played kickball. But then they were all\'NOO COME ON YOU CAN\'T BE THAT BAD\'and I was like\'HAHAH THAT\'S WHAT YOU THINK\'and then they made me kick it and I ran to the wrong base. Actually, I didn\'t even run to a base, I just ran to this random mat that I thought was a base, but was just IN THE WAY, and POINTLESS, kind of like the interpretive dancing at the Oscars. But you know what would\'ve made this experiment far less painful? IF I HAD BEEN WEARING THIS: Along with paying a visit to the 60\'s (my favorite era, which is probably some kind of twist of FATE) (see what I did there? Bob Dylan song? 60\'s?) (Oh wait, that song is actually 70\'s. I...fail. Anyway.) Miu Miu was almost cartoonish with its giant bows, poppy colors, scallops, exaggerated pocket piping, and shoe skirts that a,\'ed an extra clunky stomping factor to the overall effect. And there were LOTS of embellishments with metallic bows and flowers, kind of as if the wearer was a little girl going through her grandma\'s jewelry box (from when grand mam mam had her 60\'s heydey) and sort of decorating herself with brooches. It started out with the bright colors and cartoon-ish lace (which I will now refer to as the little sister of Prada\'s ) but towards the end got to a place that was darker, a different kind of romantic, slightly stark.. The silhouettes, colors, and fabrics became more sophisticated, and the playful, wiry flower brooches were replaced by some in full bloom. There were parts I didn\'t care for or that wouldn\'t have really improved today\'s game of kickball, (which is now the new standard for everything: would it improve my pitiful, athletically-challenged mi,\'le school experiences? WOULD IT?) such as the low cut-overall situations and skirts-over-pants (maybe because I was too reminded of my 3rd grade days when I decided I was really edgy and //alt for wearing a skirt over a pair of jeans. THE MEMORIES, MAKE THEM STOPPPPPP). They didn\'t feel out of place in the collection but my sentiments for them were those of Enid\'s here: The spring collection will always be my favorite, and that kind of magic can\'t happen twice. But over all, it was cute and fun and Miu Miu. And it still would\'ve made that really awful game of kickball much, much better. Prada Fall 2008 / Miu Miu Fall 2010. Hussein Chalayan was based around the idea of a mirage, though that fact was no MIRAGE as the sunglasses sai,\'dMIRAGE\'. Dad jokes! In all seriousness, because this is serious business, as things always are around here, I first thought it was sort of arbitrary, but the more I looked through it and thought about it the more it made sense, and the fact that it was hard to understand at first only made me like it more. And made it more, of course, like a mirage. I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE, MR. CHALAYAN. There were binoculars stuffed up with shearling and leather, hazy nebula-like prints, foggy sheer fabrics, and crocheted jackets that only half-covered the top part of the body. Without the concept, the clothes didn\'t seem to flow from one look to another too well, but I don\'t think a Hussein Chalayan collection can be viewed without knowing that there has to be a concept, anyway. The\'mirage\'sunglasses reminded me of New Year\'s Eve sunglasses, in a good way. I am not normally one for red carpet dressing (other than the CFDA gala) and last night we didn\'t even get Tilda or Cate, AND the co-hosting was awkward, AND Twilight is not a horror movie, and Zac Efron STILL HIGHLY RESEMBLES A NEOPET, but Carey Mulligan filled the Prada void that would have been otherwise occupied by Tilda with this dress that looks very pretty and normal at first... But then when you look at a closer picture, you see this, and if you happen to be looking at the closer picture while it\'s really late and night and you just ate/drank your weight in sugary products, your reaction is 3x the excitement, or, UDISGHDSLUGWHUIWGSD Tiny kitchen utensils! For tiny murderers! Chick is basically wearing a Clue gameboard, AND IT IS FANTASTIC. And Robert Downey Jr. looked awesome. I would like to think that he and Michelle Obama play kickball together in their matching Lanvin sneakers. WELL DONE, SHERLOCK, WELL DONE. That\'s about it. Again, don\'t really care for red carpet-type stuff BUT throw some tiny knives and bow ties into the mix and I am intrigued. Oh, and TOM FORD. Throw Tom Ford into the mix and I am also intrigued, and also maybe sitting two inches away from the screen, never mind that it is in the corner of the room hanging from a ceiling. I use my floating powers when necessary, okay? Lastly, I love you all more than rainbows. Vivienne Westwood was like a Maurice Sendak character that runs away to start her own kingdom, AKA, what I would like to do, all the time, a lot. Paper crowns, crayon scribbles (some of which read\'Prince Charming\') and drapy dresses that could\'ve come out of an older sister\'s dress-up box..plus, only Vivs could put her models in marker moustaches (time for me to revisit TOMAS , perhaps?) and it still make sense. And, going back to the Maurice Sendak thing: Wild Rumpus crowns, anyone? That star on that grey sweatshirt is TOTALLY Really Rosie? LIFE COMPLETE. At the Independent Fashion Bloggers conference at NYFW, there was a panel including the Fashionista girls, Susie Bubble , Phil Oh , Bryanboy , and myself, and we talked about-WAIT FOR IT- the future of fashion blogging ! Pretty RANDOM topic, if you ask me. There\'s a video but I\'m too afraid to watch it because I probably said some stupid things. But! If I were to paraphrase, I would say we mostly talked about: -Discretion when it comes to accepting gifts or freebies. -Advice to new bloggers. (Which mostly came to: write about what is interesting to you. What works for one blogger doesn\'t always work for another, and writing about the exact same stuff that a popular blogger writes about will go unnoticed since someone else is already doing the same thing.) -A blogger\'s place at Fashion Week. -Hey, remember when we all decided we were the greatest people ever and that blogs were the new everything? Me neither! The media likes the story but it ain\'t no big thang. -We can\'t predict the future of fashion blogging. The same way no one saw it coming, no one knows where it will go. The big difference between bloggers and journalists isn\'t the fact that we\'re using computers. I mean, Cathy Horyn and Lynn Yaeger have blogs, lots of critics write for style.com, and a number of editors, including Hamish Bowles and Andre Leon Talley, write blog posts; but it\'s not the same as my having a blog - the difference is experience. It\'s not remarkable that we\'re using the internet!!! but what most people are pointing out - with me, mostly, since this doesn\'t apply to the other bloggers that were on the panel - is lack of experience. I haven\'t gone to journalism school, I haven\'t had any internships, etc. And I\'m 13, which, oh my God, I can\'t tell you how excited I am to outgrow that number. This, honestly, is what I think is the future of fashion blogging, or at least part of it. The same way teenagers can start a Flickr account and be noticed by a magazine, or a band can start a MySpace and be picked up by a label, blogs will act as jumping-off platforms for people that want to work in the industry. When I started Style Rookie in March of 2008, only ElleGirl and teenvogue.com would write about blogs. It wasn\'t a big media thing and having one wasn\'t an affiliation for Fashion Week, it was a nice circle of ladies and occasional dudes who supported each other and often found themselves saying\'Thank you for this post! None of my friends get my feelings about ______.\'Then some of us started taking opportunities that had arisen, and I spent some money on a Hussein Chalayan dress, and then all of a su,\'en it was like, JUDAAAAAAAAAAS. Which is, you know, bizarre. Allow me to direct you to this epic Dave Eggers essay . So now my inbox and comment section are full of\'Can you critique my blog? Can you tell me what to do to get invited to shows? How do I get my blog recognized in the industry?\'which isn\'t a bad thing, I guess (other than the critiquing thing, which like..it\'s about you and your thoughts. No one is able to tell you what to think or how to explain your thinking to others.) Now blogging is a full-time job for some people and in some cases a segway into the industry but I guess that\'s the way it goes. And it\'s sort of a bummer, especially because now I\'m far more aware of the number of people that read my blog, and when I take this into consideration when writing a post I feel pressured to sound smarter or fancier when mostly I just enjoy writing journal-like streams of thought (my blog has always been a virtual diary) even though I\'m supposed to be writing grand reviews because a newspaper or magazine told whoever to expect that. That\'s a problem with my own outlook, though, and I still enjoy blogging. A lot. And, thankfully, it doesn\'t have to be a job for me. When it starts to feel like one, I\'ll stop. But I don\'t think anyone is saying blogs are the equivalent to magazines, or inexperienced bloggers like myself are the equivalent to journalists, anyway. Still, there is nothing wrong with having a range of perspectives. I think fashion is important to discuss. Which brings me to this recent Isabel Marant quotation: \'For me, fashion shows are not for the public, they are trade shows for the press. It\'s time for the press to understand the collection and then spread the information. That\'s more interesting than just the image. Everyone wants to be first. It\'s too too much. There should be privacy and mystery. There is no excitement about anything anymore as everything is available immediately and all the time   you don\'t have to wait for anything. I don\'t like the idea of being flooded with image and information. I don\'t belong to the generation of spending time on the internet. I think it\'s too fast and too fake. It\'s like going to a museum on the internet   where is the pleasure? It\'s sad because everyone is running after everything, but after what? Everything is too quick. There is no room in your heads for all this information. No one retains anything.\' I think that when it comes to fashion shows being online, it\'s exposure for a brand. I think that a customer deserves to see the show and get to know the world of that label. I like privacy and mystery too, but there\'s a fine line between that and exclusivity. And-TWIST!-I also hate the fastness of the Internet! And the fakeness! I like buying my magazines and zines and having special stuff I can hold in my hand! And this Internet, it makes the already fast fashion very very fast! And it\'s scary and a lot of it feels very unauthentic and sad. And fast. But, in five years, the iPhone will be Oldy McOldster from Oldsville, Oldesota. And tumblr then will be like xanga now. Who knows where fashion blogging will be. Point is, things are changing.\'Classics with a twist!\'Retro futurism! In fashion, all those cliches have been done time and again, but I think that Nicolas Ghesquiere\'s collection for Balenciaga was the only one as of recent to elevate these concepts to a level that was more refined and thoughtful.\'Retro futurism\'didn\'t mean the Jetsons, and\'classics\'didn\'t mean camel coats or button-downs. They were elements of home-living and domesticity that were brought into the present with what has now become Nicolas LongName\'s signature futurism aesthetic. He said his goal was\'to ennoble every day objects.\'Mission accomplished. Ew, that makes me think of Tom Cruise, which makes me think of him jumping on Oprah\'s couch. And we don\'t like to talk about that here. So instead I will say,\'A+\'! But that makes me think of school, and it is the weekend, so we don\'t like to talk about that here, either. Gosh, is there a reason that there isn\'t a way to say\'GOOD JOB\'without being reminded of something terribly disturbing? Well...I guess I could always just say\'good job.\'So, um, good job, Nicky G! (Why do I think this much about these things?) ANYWAY. Futuristic classics! Right! On the far left and far right, updated versions of quilting. The texture on the nude dress reminded me of doilies or lace napkins, and a simple wool sweater was brought into the future with bright green, sort of geometric threading (which really makes me think of that one lily pad game from Zoombinis . In a good way!) The shoes (which were totally killer) were the greatest indication of this - oxfords or loafers or a wood-looking material elevated with geometric shapes and of what looked like minerals (and whose patterns and colors reminded me a lot of Snood . WHY IS THIS COLLECTION THE SUMMARY OF OUR FAMILY COMPUTER\'S ACTIVITY FROM THE YEARS 2002-2005?) The closing looks were WORDS. Lots of em. Some looked like newspaper or tabloid headlines, and some were in electric clock fonts. In a few looks, they were attached to and appeared to be pouring out of the skinny-legged pants, and in others, were printed on ninja star-shaped marshmallows held together by their corners. I couldn\'t figure out what this was getting at, but have a feeling it has to do with bringing communication to a new medium. HA. Yeah, that\'s all I got. As a look, I dig it, though. There were then pieces that weren\'t so obviously on the same wavelength as the collection\'s concept when broken down, but still felt just as modern. Palettes from Spring were updated , grey coats like the one below were simple as silhouettes but calmly assertive. Same goes for the textural pants mixed with humble striped sweaters. Also? That dress next to the lil orange number? Needs to be styled with sheer Rodarte AW10 pants? Because it would look pretty and what I say goes? GOOD.
The dune itself is the tallest in the UAE at over 300 meters, and the grade of the hill is roughly 50 degrees. Sharp, huh?The turbocharged engines themselves costs $90,000 USD and up, and some drivers watch that $90,000 go up in flames. Going...Going...Gone!The driver in the shot above slowly reversed down the dune, and got out unscathed. This driver was not so lucky.He rolled forward a couple of times up the hill, and then, after watching the video on youtube, he rolled what looked to be about 18+ complete turns down to the bottom of the hill.Through the grapevine we are told that the driver did not survive. If any readers can provide a,\'itional information, that would be helpful.You can read more about the Liwa Festival and the Mureeb Challenge in this article by The National. As mentioned in a previous post, it does rain in the desert. November-February tend to be the wetter months, but random storms are known to occur outside of the \'winter\' months. I snapped these shots several weeks ago (using my mobile camera) when the UAE was hit with a series of rainstorms that our storm sewers simply couldn\'t accommodate. I was on my way home from work, and couldn\'t believe the amount of standing water.Later that same evening, there was so much water in the Khalidiya part of town that parked sedans were victims of the \'wake\' caused by moving traffic. Many of them had water splashing midway up the door.My students reacted to the rain much the way kids in the U.S. respond to snow. They were happy to dance around and enjoy it while it lasted
the culprit, circle side in... We haven\'t taken it out to play yet, but I\'m sure we will soon. That means sooner or later a \'Jeep\' post will be in the future! Probably later than sooner, because it\'s not broke in yet. But when that day comes, you\'ll know! I left out the details on this post &amp; just wanted to get back into the swing of things. I miss you all &amp; look forward to new adventures in this new year!.......Sooner than later....... Just a quick note to let you know I have been a little busy lately. In October, my laptop with all my saved pictures decided not to work anymore, (I did buy a new one), so it has been hard for me to write on the blog. Most people have put their motorcycles away for winter, so riding has been limited also. I miss riding &amp; writing and will be back at this A.S.A.P!It IS the Holidays and things have been crazy for everyone, I\'m sure.                                                               From My family to yours                                                                ~HAPPY HOLIDAYS~ View Larger MapAs most of you already know, I bought a new camera and needed an excuse to use it, so on Saturday October 31st we headed out for a ride. As you can tell from the map, it wasn\'t a long ride, but we cruised the many curves and made it an all day event anyway.We stopped in Hornitos (which is a very small community) to use the facilities and wet our whistle. Check out this antique cash register that is still in use!As we were gettin
Just a quick post to let you all know that St Vincent\'s Op Shop&nbsp; (10 Costas Drive, Hoppers Crossing) are open on Sundays from 11am (not too sure it could be 10am) to 3 pm. This is the only op shop, that I know of, which is open on Sundays AND their items are still reasonably priced! Do you know of any other op shops that are open on Sundays? If so do tell! Till next time... VF P.S. I\'m holding my first ever giveaway! Make sure you enter at http://www.vintagefokus.blogspot.com/ Before I became a stay at home Mum, I worked in South Melbourne. I would visit the Emerald Hill Op-Shop at least once a week and found quite a few bargains over the years. I dropped in when I was last in South Melbourne, which I think was some time last year. The shop had changed and it was quite pricey. I found this movie on ABC iView all about the ladies that have run the shop for years. You can see an excerpt here. An unexpected op shop visit to the Red Cross Shop in the mall in Oakleigh yielded this pretty floral sheet for $5. I\'m going to use it for fabric - I\'ve already created a lined wrap skirt for my Etsy shop, and there\'s still quite a bit left to make something else. Vinnies in Crewe Street, Oakleigh, is great for books. Au Revoir by Mary Moody (once a presenter on Gardening Australia) made me want to run away to France, too (mind you, I\'d run away to almost anywhere I\'m so keen to go travelling again!). The red book is a great basic guide to knitting, in the Pelham Craft Series (I have another of these on soft toy making) and published in 1973. It might actually encourage me to learn a couple of new stitches and make something other than socks and scarves! Each of these was a mere $1. I did a spot of op-shopping this weekend and found this gorgeous retro print of a little boy and his dog standing in the rain. I think it is a \'kitsch\' type of print but I\'m just guessing from what little research I\'ve done on the net . It is very \'vintage\' and I thought it would be a perfect a,\'ition to the nursery   not to mention too cute to pass on. http://www.vintagefokus.blogspot.com/ There is a run of good opshops along this road. Vinnies, the Salvos, and another which supports a local charity. I dropped into each of them yesterday while I was over that side of town (I\'m not often over there), and bought these few items: Wrist watch marked at $20, I paid $10. The metal on the band of my old watch has gone strange, kind of gritty, and is uncomfortable against my skin, so I thought it was about time for a new one. I like plain clear faces on watches, with numerals instead of dots, so this is ideal. The Salvos were having a \'everything is half price\' day, otherwise I might not have paid $20 for it. This is one of those cards that has digital sound when you open it - this one being kookaburras laughing. They are one of my favourite birds, so for $4 I grabbed it, just for fun. I\'ve been looking for something cool to swan around the house in on hot days, and would have preferred cotton, but it is very hard to find 100% cotton clothes these days, so I settled for this shift thingy for $6. I\'ve lost some of these hooks from our curtains over the years, and have never got around to replacing them, so when I saw a box of these for 20c each, it was finally time to fix those darn curtains! I\'d arranged to meet friends for coffee, and they said if they weren\'t in the cafe, they\'d be in the opshop nearby, and sure enough, that\'s where they were. I\'d been in the same shop two days ago, but for a small shop they have a fast turnover, and there is always new stuff! I found this really ugly blouse for $1, with pretty machine embroidered Xmas motifs on it. When I got home, I cut out the motifs and cut off the buttons. The rest of the shirt is in hubby\'s rag bag. Somebody had apparently been to the USA and bought a heap of souvenir cloth badges, but never got around to sewing them on to articles of clothing. I\'ll be cutting them up to embellish fabric postcards, ATCs, or other patchwork. 40 cents each. I love anything with Peacocks, so I wasn\'t going to leave this little brass dish beind - 50 cents! There was a basket full of laces for $1 a roll, so I grabbed these to share with a friend in the USA who loves laces. The lady at the counter said\'Oh that lace has been going out the door today!\'and I wondered what else I\'d missed out on! These finds are from a trip to Frankston in December, to take advantage of one of Saver\'s half price garment Mondays. There are enough op shops in the main shopping area to make a day trip a worthwhile exercise - I think I visited five, including Savers. Above are a jumper and cardigan which I intend to deconstruct for the yarn. You can\'t ever have too much yarn :) The purple cardi has giant snaps down the front, which I\'ll also reclaim and repurpose. I\'d priced snaps about this size in the haberdashery section a while back and they retail for at least $1 each, and I have six of them now. Both knits were two or three dollars each. A large scarf featuring a gorgeous print of horses. I tried to convince the checkout operator that scarves are apparel, but apparently they\'re considered accessories and not included in the half price offer. Still a bargain at $3.95, I think. I may turn this one into a halter top, if I can bear to cut it. A cowboy motif doona cover that I\'ll use as fabric. I couldn\'t resist the cute print. Enough here to make a shirt, a skirt and still have some left over. Can\'t remember the price exactly, but it was about $5. A gorgeous green caftan, for me to wear in the heat. Cool and comfortable now that I\'ve altered it to my satisfaction: it was a little tight over the Rack of Doom, so I let it out at the side seams only to find that this rendered it rather shapeless in other areas. So I a,\'ed a couple of waist ties to tie at the back and now I love it. $9 at Savers. An\'Eight Wives of Henry the VIII\'tea towel, to be refashioned into a tote bag. $1.95. (Edited: Obviously that was meant to be\'Six Wives of Henry VIII\'- I think Melbourne\'s hot and muggy spell has damaged my brain) An Isle of Wight tea towel, also to be refashioned into a tote bag. Also $1.95. Both tea towels from Savers. On the same trip, I also bought ten balls of black mohair yarn, at $1 a ball in St Vinnies, plus a set of dominoes for $2 in another op shop (can\'t remember which, memory failure due to hot weather). Like I wrote earlier, can\'t have too much yarn! The dominoes are intended for a jewellery project I have in mind, and they came in a little wooden box that I\'ll use for something else. A good day. I would love to read about it if you did. I\'d love to go on a trip like that, but I really don\'t need to...I do my own opshop tours without any help, lol. Popped into the local Brotherhood shop again today and found these goodies. It really is a neat little shop, they always seem to have new stuff coming in, and put it on the shelves within minutes of receiving and pricing it! They are just down the road from me; too close really....I can\'t resist dropping in when I walk by ;-) This cotton hand embroidered cloth was 40 cents. I\'ve got hundreds, but this is so beautifully stitched, I couldn\'t leave it behind for that price. I fell in love with this enamel brooch for $4, thinking I would use it to embellish a crazy patchwork block, but when I got it home and had a closer look, I decided no, it\'s too good for that, so it\'s in my jewellery box. Here is the brooch again, with a bead necklace for 50 cents. I would normally not have looked twice at that, but have a look at the top I was wearing today - perfect match!!
I am not ashamed to say that I am a dork. An internet geek. Next to Ella, my computer is my best friend. And it\'s one of the best friends a girl could have. It doesn\'t give me attitude; it would never leave me for another user; it wouldn\'t borrow money and then disappear. Yes, I\'m happy to say that our relationship is truly solid. That\'s not to say I haven\'t had some bad ones in the past, but ever since I got together with my Mac, it\'s been pure bliss... As a quick aside, I happen to love the series of Mac vs. PC ads created by Apple. In case you aren\'t familiar with them, here\'s one (I chose one with a dog in it for the sake of blog relevancy) Anyway, I hop into bed with Mac every night. Ella\'s not particularly happy to have to share the bed with him. She usually puts up a fight and tries to draw my attention away from his glossy screen by digging at the bed, climbing in my lap, or just plain barking in my face. Yes, my little girl is the epitome of subtle and mature. But, as with most, Ella can only hate on Mac for so long before she realizes that, well, he\'s pretty freakin\' cool. See for yourselves... Don\'t be alarmed, folks. My Mac is NOT growing an o,\', furry appendage... ...nor has Apple developed the technology to spawn animal hindquarters (at least, not to my knowledge)... That\'s just my Ella finally letting go of her completely unfounded objections to Mac... ...and feeling totally good about it.\'Ohhhhh, man....it never felt this good with PC.\'How many creatures do you imagine could squeeze into my little shoebox of an apartment? Lord knows I\'ve complained before about it being too small for Ella and myself, so any more than two would certainly be a bad idea, right? Well, for kicks, I decided to test that out Labor Day weekend when my parents (Ella\'s grandfurma and grandfurpa) came to stay with me and also brought their 12 year old dog, Jenna.\'Five living things coexisting in a tiny apartment for 36 hours\'may not actually break any Guinness world records , but I wonder if\'Five living things almost losing their minds while failing to peacefully coexist in a tiny apartment\'would? Ok well I should clarify that it was really the furry inhabitants that disturbed the peace. The drama began when I busted out the aerobed . Ella is not a fan of self-inflation - that much was made clear as she ran to her protector (the toilet bowl) to get away from the weird blue rapidly growing monster that makes\'ssssssssssssss\'noises... Of course, when faced with the choice of sleeping on the cold, hard bathroom floor, or cu,\'ling with momma on the crazy bed, she demonstrated a miraculous recovery... Of course, that is not to say that Ella didn\'t try to recoup her spot on the real bed and tell grandma to bugger off... But the activity that caused all the humans in the shoebox to drink heavily and look for ways to pop the top off or bust through the sides or SOMETHING was the incessant posturing between Jenna and Ella. Momentarily fearful of the aerobed , they soon both decided to take it over. As you can see by their expressions, the take-over was not a joint effort and it would take a battle royale to determine who would ultimately become Queen of the Faux Mattress. Only Ella doesn\'t truly battle over anything because she doesn\'t take anything seriously. Yelling, lunging, barking, howling...all signs of play to my Ella. Dominance schmominance. Territory? Mi territory es su territory! No worries! Let\'s just play! Jenna\'s response? Shut it, kid...I haven\'t played in years and I\'m not about to start with you... In the end, I\'d call it a draw. Jenna and Ella agreed to disagree and the humans parted ways with hugs and headaches. If I were a journalist, I\'d surely be fired for being this late on a story. Lucky for me, I\'m not a journalist - I\'m a blogger. And I\'ve got puppy pics that are timeless in their adorability. I can even make up words like\'adorability\'...with this kind of freedom, why would anyone want to bother reporting on legitimate and current news? Anyway, in case you hadn\'t heard, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the development of the original design plans for Central Park, the Central Park Conservancy and the New York City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation set up a hot air balloon ride for New Yorkers and visitors alike to catch a bird\'s eye view of the City and the Park. The balloon was flying through August 22nd. Sorry you missed it. If the site\'s still up, you can get more detail on it here . (but why bother...it\'s over and done...perhaps you should just scroll down to the cute puppy pics below since that\'s what you\'re here for anyway) Strangely, dogs aren\'t weren\'t permitted on the balloon ride. Perhaps it\'s too risky having all that fur flying around so close to the flames of the burner (although I bet the FURminator could take care of that)...Or maybe it\'s because the basket wasn\'t intended for quadrupeds, so allowing them would mean fewer riders per trip and less $$ in the balloon company\'s pocket (Cue hard-nosed journalistic headline:\'Dogs keep Aeroballoon\'s profits from reaching the sky\')... Honestly my biggest concern was that Ella would have caught the urge to indulge her predatory bird instinct at 500 feet in the air. So we thought it best to admire the balloon from the safety of the ground at Cherry Hill . Sorry I don\'t have any aerial shots for you, but aren\'t pics of Ella with her tongue hanging out WAY cuter? Enjoy. And here are some views of the balloon from the northwest side of The Lake ... Ella LOVES horses... almost as much as horse poop. (sorry - but it\'s true...that sh-- is like doggie catnip!) But while she might admire them from afar as they majestically trot through the park, she isn\'t too keen on them being all up in her water trough. Only it\'s not technically Ella\'s trough (try telling her that). This is one of the troughs along Central Park South dedicated to the carriage horses by the ASPCA . And the truth of the matter is that Ella is too much of a diva to stick her head in and drink directly from the trough anyway. Momma had to fill her portable plastic cup from the spigot like we do at all the other people-dedicated water fountains (momma\'s actually ok with that - if you saw how dirty that water was, you would be too). Anyway, point is, Ella was really lapping up that nice cold water in her clean personal cup when she came face to face with the one animal she has never (yet) tried to incite play with (thank god)... Horse to Ella:\'You betta check yo\'self.\'Horse again to Ella:\'Uh huh, that\'s what I thought.\'Ella to Horse: (mumbling under her breath)\'Oh come on this is getting ridiculous now. Nobody needs THAT much water...\'Ella to herself:\'OK THAT IS IT! I\'m about to make my move if this horse doesn\'t trot on in 10 seconds.\'Ella to Momma:\'Momma are you sure you don\'t have any Poland Spring in your bag? I am so parched...\'You might have noticed that I\'ve been a bit light with the blog postings lately. I can\'t deny it - guilty as charged. But there are extenuating circumstances, I swear. I have proof. Ladies and gentlemen, exhibit A. Meet Ella - The Energizer Puppy. If I didn\'t know better, I\'d swear she was plugged into the wall somewhere because her energy just never seems to drain. It is my only mission in life to find SOMETHING that will tire Ella out so that momma can get a moment to relax (is ONE moment too much to ask for?). Thankfully, I recently managed to find something that occupied Ella for one evening (hey, I\'ll take it) - a puppy-sized stuffed toy creatively named\'Monkey\'. I owe Monkey a great deal for this - he not only filled in as Ella\'s playmate for an evening, but also provided priceless entertainment... Ella was so excited to meet Monkey that I didn\'t even have time to remove his tags and stickers before she pounced. Ella shows Monkey she ain\'t afraid of no primates.\'Yeah, a lot of good those opposable thumbs are doing you now, eh Monkey?!!\'Say uncle! Say uncle!!\'Ella puts Monkey in a head lock. He looks surprisingly comfortable. Monkey tries to gain advantage by tickling Ella - she laughs uncontrollably but won\'t relent. Time out. Like true competitors, in the end they lay down and snuggle and put the match behind them. (Wait, that\'s not what Nadal and Federer did after the finals of Wimbledon this year? Hmm. Humans are weird.) Anyway, Monkey succeeded in draining Ella\'s batteries for a little while. The question in my mind is, who will take on Ella next? Because right now, momma is saying uncle. UNCLE!!!\'Oh, look!...is it a puppy?\'Yes, she\'s not quite 8 months.\'Oh, she\'s beautiful. Is she trained?\'Um, how so? I mean, she housetrained but eh er uh...\'Silence.\'She\'s a good girl - for the most part. She\'s just got a lot of energy.\'Well of course...she\'s a puppy! Is she a chewer?\'Definitely, yes, I\'m going bankrupt buying bones to keep her mouth occupied!\'Does she chew on your shoes?\'Haha...well if there\'s no bone around, she\'s got to chew on something right?\'-coughs, looks down at the ground out of embarrassment, scurries off- Look, don\'t blame me! I\'m clearly doing all I can to train Ella properly. To ensure she chews only on designated toys and bones. To teach my furbaby the difference between a\'good chew\'and a\'bad chew\'. Are you saying there\'s some reason Ella might think that because it\'s ok to chew on this toy... ...it\'s ok to chew on this too?... I don\'t see the connection. Sorry. Today was one of the most beautiful days we\'ve had in NYC in a long time. Perhaps it\'s the relative lack of humidity that\'s got me feeling so good...or maybe I\'m deficient in Vitamin D and the sunshine has replenished me...in truth I think I really owe it all to Christopher Cross. He\'s in my head, he won\'t leave, and I\'m totally fine with it. As Ella and I made our way around the Conservatory Water in Central Park, we both found ourselves smiling at all of the sailboats. For those of you who aren\'t familiar, the Conservatory Water is an ornamental boat pond of sorts where people can casually sail (or race - for the true sportsman or uptight New Yorker) sailboats. It\'s a relaxing place to begin with, but the sailboats just a,\' to the magic. And I couldn\'t help but set the whole scene to music - Christopher Cross\'s\'Sailing\'. I think I kept the theme music mostly inside my head, though I can\'t deny there may have been some humming aloud during the chorus. Now it\'s your turn to hum along... I recently relayed the news about Ella gutting her beloved Raffy. The loss was so su,\'en and shocking that I made the decision to keep Raffy\'s remains around for as long as I could. Sick, maybe...but with his stuffing fully gone, I figured he couldn\'t pose much of a threat to Ella\'s digestive system, and frankly I really like Raffy and am perfectly happy tossing his limp shell around the shoebox for Ella to chase. Earlier this evening, I noticed Ella was hiding under my desk, shooting me a guilty look out of the corner of her eye. I knew immediately that meant she had something in her mouth that she knew damn well she ought not to. I pried open her jaws of steel, and a round, brown, mushy ball-shaped thing dropped into my hand. I screamed bloody murder at first, thinking it was part of a bodily organ of another animal she\'d killed, or a piece of some kind of nasty that she\'d snuck in from the mean city streets...in a few seconds though, my squeals turned to hysterical laughter as I realized what it was. Ladies and gentlemen, exhibit A: And Exhibit B: And Exhibit C: Ella\'s wrath directed toward Raffy is relentless! The poor thing is now eviscerated and sans eye. If I had to venture a guess, I\'d say Ella will take the other eye next and then move on to his ear. I will say, though...I\'ve never seen ANYTHING keep Ella\'s attention quite so much as Raffy\'s eye. Perhaps I\'ll hold onto the eyes and use them as training treats. That might be a good, maximum incentive treat to use while we\'re practicing\'Come\'...even filet mignon couldn\'t top a furry eyeball apparently.
Oh I hear ya...He\'s just a two year old how hard could it be?Ah-ha, thought you\'d never ask!Here\'s just one example of what I\'ve been going through...Just the other day...I had to make a very important phone call. As the phone on the other end is ringing, I spotted Madisen and asked her to run and see where Jake was. ( As I know it only takes a second before he\'s into something.)\'He\'s fine, Kailey\'s going to play with him while your on the phone.\', She said.Approximately 20 minutes later I get off the phone, turn around, and see Jake walking towards me wa,\'ling like a duck. He\'s covered from head to toe with paint, making paint footprints behind him.\'Look Mommy, I paint!!\'he said in a lovely shade of purple.I can only imagine the haunting shade of white my face became, as the shock rushed over me. I immediately grabbed him up and went running for the bath tub. Screaming in panic for the girls to hurry and help, I went as fast as I could.\'Strip your clothes off, and what ever you do, DO NOT let Jake out of the tub!!\'I knew wherever the paint was, time was of the essence to get it up. As I followed the painted footprints imprinted in the carpet. (Of our RENTED house might I ad) I was led straight to the masterpiece corner! He had somehow managed to get open two containers of paint. One Red &amp; one blue.(Which were in a case and up high. Obviously not high enough!)Mr. Man, had painted the walls, his toys, his bed, his be,\'ing, and HIMSELF!
It\'s been roughly nine months since I got a sweet F-bomb out of Gordon Ramsay over the name of my blog,\'That would put a f---ing glass eye to sleep!\'Three girls and I had dinner at Mojito in Brooklyn, one of Ramsay\'s fixer-uppers on\'Kitchen Nightmares,\'and tonight\'s the night it all goes down live on Fox. Tune in at 9 p.m. ET/8C. It scares me to tell you to watch it, without having seen it myself, but it\'s sure to give you a good laugh. Let me know what you think, and if you\'ve just recently discovered my blog, click here for the colorful write-up of that eventful evening. Unless you read her book, of course. I finished reading\'My Life in France\'two days ago and the movie\'Julie &amp; Julia\'just ended on my DVR. I wanted to know Julia Child through her own words first so I could test the movie against them (or the words she wrote with her beloved husband Paul Child\'s grand-nephew Alex Prud\'homme).\'My Life in France\'was a delightful read. It made me nostalgic for my three adolescent years growing up in Paris while it also inspired me to take cooking classes. I don\'t know if I\'m cut out for Le Cordon Bleu , but an introductory course somewhere might do. If you\'re at all interested in food or cooking I highly advise reading it from cover to cover. I can\'t wait to buy\'Mastering the Art of French Cooking\'(Volumes I and II) and\'From Julia Child\'s Kitchen\'(a book Julia calls her\'favorite\'). I\'m still uninterested, however, in reading the blog-turned-book\'Julie &amp; Julia\'written by Julie Powell. I liked Powell\'s husband in the movie way more than I liked Powell (and I adore Amy Adams). I decided to share a few items that I found fascinating from Julia\'s tale. Here is a taste: 10. Julia attended Smith College. She majored in history and graduated in 1934. Her plan after college was to become a famous woman novelist. She sought employment at Time, Newsweek and The New Yorker and when she didn\'t get a job at either magazine, she worked in the advertising department at the W. &amp; J. Sloane furniture store. She made $25 a week. 9. Julia met Paul while working for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and\'looking for adventure.\'The OSS was an intelligence agency formed during World War II. The two met in Ceylon (what is now Sri Lanka) in 1944; both were transferred with the OSS to Kunming, China; and in September of 1946 they were married. Paul had a black belt in judo and was a\'physical person.\'He was a photographer and\'his pleasure was in the act of creating.\'Paul took many of the photographs Julia used to inspire the artwork in her\'Mastering\'cookbook. Julia and Paul never got around to sending Christmas cards so instead they sent their family and friends homemade Valentine\'s Day cards. The more ridiculous the better. They seemed to be an adorable couple and I hope for that kind of married happiness someday. 8. One of Julia and Paul\'s first meals in France was at Restaurant La Couronne in Rouen, the city where St. Joan of Arc was burned at the stake. Julia described it as\'the most exciting meal\'of her life. She feasted on sole meuniere and oysters. The restaurant is considered to be the oldest inn in France established just a few years ago in 1345. 7. Julia was big on nicknames. Her sister Dorothy -- five years her junior -- was nicknamed\'Dort the Wort\'while Julia was called\'Julia Pulia\'and at some times even\'Juke the Puke.\'Julia became a very good friend of the legendary James Beard (he asked Julia to call him Jim) and whenever they cooked together they were known as GiGi, as in Jim and Julie with the letter\'j\'pronounced the French way. 6. Julia attended her first cooking class at Le Cordon Bleu with 11 GIs who were\'studying cooking under the auspices of the GI Bill of Rights.\'She was the star student, although she began unable to properly scramble an egg. 5. Julia sought a diploma from Le Cordon Bleu so she could teach but she failed the first exam. It was made of two parts: a written and practical exam. She aced the written but didn\'t know how to cook a single item on the practical exam. It included the following: an oeuf mollet , a veau\'en surpise ,\'and caramel custard. Her teacher Chef Bugnard insisted that despite this debacle, Child was qualified to be a chef. She aced the second exam and became a graduate of Le Cordon Bleu. 4. On November 6, 1959, after more than seven years of collaboration, Julia\'s manuscript for a cookbook, co-written with two of her French friends Simone\'Simca\'Beck (later Madame Jean Fischbacher) and Louisette Bertholle, was rejected by the editor-in-chief at Houghton Mifflin for being\'a big, expensive cookbook of elaborate information\'that\'might well prove formidable to the American housewife. She might easily clip one of these recipes out of a magazine but be frightened by the book as a whole.\'3. The woman who would later be Julia\'s editor, Judith Jones, left New York for Paris in 1948 at the age of 24 for a three-week vacation, got her purse stolen and never left (her return ticket was in her purse). She was working for Doubleday in New York at the time and ended up getting a job as an editorial assistant to a Doubleday editor in Paris. She just so happened to pick up a book her boss was planning to reject, urged him to give it a second go and when he did, Doubleday bought it and it became a worldwide sensation. You may have heard of it:\'Ann Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl.\'A similar situation happened with Julia\'s manuscript. Jones tested several of the recipes, realized what an incredible feat it was and insisted to her bosses it be published. In May 1960 Jones sent Julia the good news.\'We have come to the conclusion it is a unique book that we would be very proud to have on the Knopf list.\'2. The original title of\'Mastering\'was\'French Recipes for American Cooks\'and Jones said no way. Early contenders were\'The Master French Cookbook\'and\'The French Cooking Master.\'Until finally\'Mastering the Art of French Cooking.\'Et voila! Bon appetit! 1. Julia and Paul called their homes by names. They lived at 81 Rue de L\'Universite in Paris and they called it\'Rue de Loo.\'They called their property in Provence La Pitchoune or\'Little Thing.\'Julia held onto La Peetch for nearly 30 years -- from 1965 until June 1992. Paul was 90 and living in a nursing home outside Boston at the time when she decided to move on from their\'spiritual home.\'When asked if she was going to miss it, Julia replie,\'dI\'ve always felt that when I\'m done with something I just walk away from it -- fin !\'She a,\'e,\'dthe heart had gone out of it for me now.\'Sad, in a way, but I know exactly what she meant. Aphrodisiac: a food, drink or drug that stimulates sexual desire; a thing that causes excitement. We\'ve all heard of the term, and at one point or another, I\'m sure we\'ve all consumed one or several of them. Has it made you hornier or more of a sex machine? The jury\'s out, but for a different take on the Valentine\'s Day list of restaurants, here\'s my top 10 sexual helpers paired up with the places you can find them in New York City. Have fun and best of luck with finding love and some heat this weekend. 10. Asparagus Asparagus \'stirs up lust in man and woman,\'wrote a 17th century herbalist. Asparagus is a great source of potassium, fiber, vitamin B6, vitamins A and C, and thiamin and folic acid. Folic acid is known for boosting histamine production necessary for the ability to reach orgasm in both sexes. You\'ll find the best asparagus dish in the city at Riposo 72 . The sleeper wine bar on the Upper West Side grills its asparagus and wraps them in prosciutto and a thin layer of melted parmesan. It\'s to die for. 9. Avocado Like the asparagus, the avocado is rich in folic acid. And just look at it. Its shape alone is sexual. So much so that Catholic priests in Spain once forbade it. The best way to eat avocado is sliced on a sandwich, in sushi or chopped up in guacamole. For the first, head to Cafe Ronda for their chipotle sandwich with chicken, onions and avocados. For sushi head to BondSt for their salmon avocado roll. You\'ll find the best guacamole in the city at Mama Mexico on the Upper West Side or at any Rosa Mexicano location. The freshly-made guac is the stuff and both of these Mexican-themed restaurants chop the avocado right in front of you. 8. Bananas In a,\'ition to potassium, bananas contain chelating minerals and the bromeliad enzyme, that are believed to enhance the male libido. Look at your significant other, start pealing one and eat it in front of him or her with a straight face. Have fun with that. The only bananas I\'ve eaten in this city, excluding the ones for 60 cents at my office cafeteria, have been on pancakes. Head to Norma\'s for a sick short stack. Their banana-macadamia nut flap jacks with whipped banana and brown sugar butter are off the charts. 7. Foie Gras I\'ve never been a huge fan of foie gras (or how they treat the ducks in the process), but if you\'re a Francophile in search of some loving, hit up Bar Boulud . They have an excellent selection of foie gras and pates. Try their country pate foie gras with truffle juice and port. Whether it\'s the ingredients or the fine food\'s mystique that grabs you, if eating it makes you feel sexy, go for it. 6. Basil Smelling basil alone puts me under. Head to Kuma Inn for their steamed edamame with Thai basil-lime oil. If you prefer going the Italian route, head to Gradisca for a couple of options. Not only is this one of my favorite Italian spots in the city, but it\'s romantic as well and you can try their caprese salad with basil or the cavatelli pasta with tomato, eggplant and basil. 5. Pine Nuts Pine nuts are high in zinc -- a mineral necessary to maintain male potency. Kefi has an incredible dish with pine nuts: the sheep\'s milk dumplings with tomatoes, pine nuts and warm, soft feta. If I could I would eat at Kefi once a week. An alternative to the dumplings would be Frederick\'s caprese salad with pine nuts sprinkled on top. 4. Chocolate Chocolate contains chemicals thought to effect neurotransmitters in the brain. The Aztecs once called chocolate the\'nourishment of the gods.\'Sfoglia serves an incredible pasta dish with chocolate: its gnocchi with mushroom and chocolate shavings. If you\'d rather have chocolate in a sexy dessert, head to Artisanal for their romantic chocolate fondue. 3. Garlic The\'heat\'in garlic is said to stir sexual desires. I eat garlic in just about anything, but one of my favorite dishes in the city is at Esperanto . They serve mussels on the half shell, roasted with garlic, topped with parmesan and paprika. Pair the mussels with one of Esperanto\'s exceptional Brazilian cocktails and you\'re sure to score big this weekend. Good also flaunts its mussels with tons of garlic in a,\'ition to white wine, herbs and grilled country bread. 2. Wine We all know red wine can be awfully seductive and this city has its fair share of places to find it. Though wine bars have a rather effeminate sound to them, don\'t fear, gents, bring your gal to one of these low-key spots and you\'ll be a hit. Riposo 72 makes it on the aphrodisiac list twice. You don\'t even have to taste the wine here to feel sexy -- you\'ll feel hot just holding their huge wine glasses. Their cozy warm atmosphere is heavy on the romance as well. Taste is another favorite of mine for vino. For more generous pours head to i Trulli , Peasant , Bar Boulud , Grape and Grain , and clo wine bar at Columbus Circle. If you want to stay in with your honey, head to Morrell\'s in Rockefeller Center or 67 Wine for my two favorite wine stores in the city. 1. Oysters The Romans were the first to label oysters as an aphrodisiac. There are many places to find oysters in New York City. The best in my book is Aquagrill in the West Village. Some runners-up would be Grand Central Oyster Bar , Jack\'s Luxury Oyster Bar and Morimoto . If you\'re in the mood for surf and turf, grab some oysters at my new favorite steakhouse Keen\'s .\'ARE YOU ALIVE?????? WHEN CAN WE GET DINNER?!?!??\'asked FunStar. She\'s always so dramatic. She produces a cable news show and they type the rundown in all caps and I think she forgets to turn off her work type from time to time. I still love her. FunStar sent me a few of these e-mails starting back in November and it took us until the first week in January to get together. She always has a wish list of places to try -- a few years back she had an Excel spreadsheet -- so I asked her to e-mail me the ones at the top of this list. Excel or no excel, when I saw Momofuku Ssam Bar on the list, I got fired up. Johnny Depp is to the Academy Award as I formerly was to David Chang\'s restaurants. (If you don\'t know Chang, please read this article before you proceed. You will not regret it. I wish Larissa MacFarquhar did profiles on all of New York City chefs. I\'ve had a crush on the guy ever since.) Momofuku restaurants have been eluding me for years. Much like Babbo once was to me, the restaurants in the Momofuku family had an unattainable quality to them. I would hear someone asking if I\'d tried Momofuku Ko, if I liked Momofuku Noodle Bar, if I wanted to go to Ssam Bar and I\'d throw my head back, roll my eyes and give them a loud\'Pfffhhaa! Good luck.\'I am the first to admit that if a restaurant is notoriously hard to get into I will avoid it at all costs, or wait around until it\'s uncool to try it. Sadly, neither Momofuku Ssam Bar nor any of its sister restaurants are getting any uncooler so FunStar gave me the kick in the pants I needed to swallow my ferocious pride and give it a whirl. There was one slight problem. Over the past four months I\'ve been eating strictly vegetarian. I feared eating at one of Chang\'s spots would be a total disaster. I even asked my Twitter followers and @eaterny if there was a point in me trying Momofuku Ssam Bar. The responses were mixed. One person wrote: don\'t go to momo if you\'re a vegetarian there are better choices. Another wrote: pork buns and spicy rice cakes...and compost cookies. Drool. While a third wrote: There are fish options and a veg or 3. I consulted the menu and it looked doable. We would dine at Momofuku Ssam Bar despite FunStar being concerned about her having to eat all the meat dishes by herself. I told her she\'d live. I showed up at 8:25-ish. The place was a zoo, yet the hostess came and found me like a magnet. When I told her I was waiting for my friend running late from work, she pointed me in the direction of the Milk Bar and said she\'d come in to check on me to see if my second party had arrived. I couldn\'t get over how friendly she was. I was surprised by the simplicity of the decor in Ssam Bar. The tables were like picnic benches with an Asian flare. The chairs were backless. Folks at tables were to the right side (and there weren\'t a lot of them) and to the other side was the bar. It seemed like some of the tables were communal. Both the bar and table areas took up an equal amount of space in the dining room. The decor wasn\'t the hype here, or the coziness. The food was. Backless chairs don\'t lend well to settling in and hanging around for hours. The horizontal wood paneling and table design reminded me of that of the Chelsea pizzeria Co. I wasn\'t entirely sure what the hostess meant by the Milk Bar. I knew it was attached but visually I couldn\'t see what she meant. I just kept following the narrow space between the bar and the tables, saw the bright light of the open kitchen at the far end of the dining room and found another hallway. At the end of this hallway there were large groups of people standing in line for bakery items, ranging from cookies and cakes to ice cream and soft serve. I guess it doubled as the waiting room. I plopped my pur-ggage on the table with a thud and made it clear I\'d be staying for a while. I whipped out Julia Child\'s\'My Life in France\'and began to alternate between reading a few paragraphs and checking out the commotion around me. I heard about four different accents in the span of 20 minutes: Bostonian, Australian, German and French. This place was no secret to foreigners. Everyone knew and idolized Chang. The four young 20-something dudes behind me were drooling over what pork plate they were going to get, how Chang\'s fried chicken was\'bad ass,\'and how they wanted a compost cookie for later. What the hell was a compost cookie? I looked up and saw it had pretzels, potato chips, butterscotch, coffee, oats and chocolate and any other crumbs lying around the kitchen Chang and his chefs could find. This was right up my alley. A petite blond college student in front of me was going on and on to her two friends about balancing studying with her long-distance boyfriend and how she was really more into hooking up locally with randoms than having a committed relationship with someone who was far away. Her boring\'far away\'man was in Boston. I was tempted to blurt out her ridiculous whining on Overheardinnewyork.com , but I decided to continue reading instead. Where was FunStar? The hostess came to check on me at least one more time before FunStar arrived. I couldn\'t believe how incredible the service was. She could have just dumped me in the back and waited for me to come find her when FunStar got there but no. She kept her word and made sure I was still solo. When FunStar did come she went and found our hostess. I almost told her not to worry she was looking out for us but I was getting pretty hungry at this point after all the compost talk so if FunStar could expedite the seat process I\'d be thrilled.\'Mona!\'She waved at me at the end of the hallway connecting the Milk Bar to Ssam.\'Really? Ready? Coming!\'I shoved my book and gloves and hat and scarf in my pur-ggage and flew off to start our Ssam adventure. We snagged a great front seat at the bar. This was perfect. We could look at the menu, ask questions and watch the bartenders at work -- one of my favorite things to do.\'So...I need an update. Like NOW!\'OK, OK... Christmas was incredible. We had the best time,\'I replied.\'Can I get you guys a drink?\'Asked a tall thin guy with a chunk of his blond hair spiked in the front and pointing off to the right like an arrow. He was wearing an interesting two-toned green T-shirt and when he stepped away it reminded me of the old hyper-color tees.\'Oh shoot. We haven\'t gotten that far yet,\'I responded.\'OK, let\'s choose our drinks and then you\'ll tell me what happene,\'dsaid FunStar. FunStar told me about a drink she\'d had recently called a French 75. Her version was made of Champagne, gin (though some recipes call for cognac or brandy) and lemon juice. We asked the bartender if he could make one. There were cocktails with Champagne on the menu, but he had an idea they weren\'t supposed to use Champagne for cocktails they didn\'t have on the menu. It sounded strange to us, but he was very smiley and friendly so we didn\'t think twice about it. I asked him about the seasonal pickle brine martini with Plymouth gin. To this dirty martini nut it sounded delish. I chose the classic with gin and FunStar went with a vodka version.\'OK. Spill it!\'So... we met at our friend\'s we,\'ing --\'Dude. I know that part. Fast forward to more recent,\'she ordered.\'Ha! OK, OK. I don\'t remember what you know and what you don\'t know. We\'ve seen each other four times now. He came to New York once and I went to Los Angeles twice--\'So you met him and you\'ve seen him three times since and you\'re totally gonzo!?\'I know, I know. It must sound totally insane. But I\'m totally insane about him. If you asked me to describe my dream man physically and emotionally it would be him. I just feel so lucky!\'I\'m so happy for you!\'Christmas was a total whirlwind. We went whale-watching with his parents. Our parents met at dinner. Everyone got along super well. I spent a week with the fam and then I flew down to L.A. to be with him for four days. It was so awesome.\'Wow,\'she responded.\'Do you guys have any questions about the menu?\'Oh... we haven\'t even looked. Sorry...\'Let\'s pick out food and we\'ll keep talking after,\'suggested FunStar.\'Done and done.\'We looked at the menu and there were a bunch of items that jumped out at us. We tried as much as we could between two girls, one being a vegetarian. As our first cocktails dried up, the bartender informed us he\'d inquired about making the French 75 and that he could in fact use the champagne for items not on the drinks menu. It was very sweet of him to pursue this further, because we had certainly forgotten, so we ordered up a round of French 75s and kept ogling at the menu. We copied our neighbors and tried the cured hamachi with edamame, horseradish and pea leaves. The horseradish was charred black and I could have eaten the crumbles by the pint. The hamachi was light and fresh with an edamame sauce. The horseradish saved this dish from being bland. Next we tried the cracked Jonah crab claws with harissa mayo. Like I mentioned below at Choptank , crab claws don\'t really do it for me. I tried to suck all the meat and juice out of the smallest claw and it was a lot of work for not a lot of substance. Next time I eat a crab it\'ll be a full sucker. FunStar wasn\'t impressed either. FunStar tried the steamed pork buns with hoisin, cucumbers and scallions. Ever since eating at Kuma Inn I\'ve loved the white gooey, almost marshmallow-like bun with pork belly. I kept to my vegetarian ways and just tried a sliver of the foamy bread and wished I could have had a plain side of the bun. I bet if I\'d asked I could have. Rats. We finished up with the bread and butter plate with two types of butter: sea salt from Vermont and whipped lardo. The bread was disappointing. It was thick and heavy on the tough crust with too little soft on the inside. Maybe Chang should outsource the one thing he\'s not an expert in -- French bread (sorry FCI). S\'il est deja en train de faire ceci, je suis tres desole. The butter, however, was ridiculous, especially the lardo. It was so rich it could have been cheese. I almost wanted to eat it plain with a spoon. I knew it would give me a heart attack so I refrained, but man. Who knew butter could be so flavorful? Chang. That\'s who. Last and definitely not least, we tried the fried brussels sprouts with mint and a fish sauce vinaigrette. With all the hype surrounding Momofuku we hadn\'t been all that moved by the food... until the brussels sprouts. I don\'t care if you\'ve never liked or tried a brussels sprout in your life, this is one of New York\'s finest dishes. No joke. I couldn\'t figure out if I wanted to just inhale them or eat them slowly so they\'d last longer. A couple sitting next to us asked what they should get and besides the pork belly and the hamachi I yelled with brussels sprouts hanging out of my mouth,\'THUH BRUHTHULL THPROUTHS!\'So? Tell me more about MaineMan!!?\'Throughout dinner it was a battle to consume what was in front of us and each other\'s lives over the past six months.\'So... what is it about him, Mona?\'I think I have a face now whenever someone mentions him. It\'s called MaineMan face and I get called out on it constantly. I light up like the tree and ice skating rink at Rockefeller Center.\'I always told my mom I needed to find myself a mountain man, a manly man, someone who was tough as nails on the outside, but a soft, sensitive guy on the inside. MaineMan is that guy.\'I love it!\'I don\'t know. I\'ll always be an athlete at heart. And I\'ve always needed someone equally as tough as me, both emotionally and physically, and I always found it hard to be attracted to someone who wasn\'t. This probably sounds ridiculous...\'NO! Go on.\'I couldn\'t date a wuss or a whiner. I\'ve never met someone tougher, more active and more ready for an adventure than he is. I asked him if he wanted to do a marathon and he said, \'Yeah, sure!\' without a second thought. Are you ki,\'ing me!?\'I know exactly what you mean. We\'re both tough cookies. I needed that too,\'she a,\'ed. It was a huge relief that what I was saying wasn\'t gibberish.\'Right?! Yet, at the same time, he\'s a complete love... a total softie. So anyway...he\'s amazing and there isn\'t a second of any day where I don\'t doubt or question what he\'s thinking or feeling. Because he tells me all the time. It\'s never a mystery. And he lives across the country! I dated someone who I practically lived with who never said the sweet things MaineMan says to me. I really can\'t...\'Mona!\'... believe how lucky I am to have found...\'Mona!\'...him. I just feel so...\'Mona!\'Oh god, sorry. What?\'You\'re totally glowing. It\'s so great. GLOW-ING! I\'m sooooo soooo happy for you.\'Aww, thanks FunStar! It\'s just crazy. And I totally get it now.\'We wrapped up dinner, thanked our bartender profusely for taking such good care of us and headed to the Milk Bar for some dessert. FunStar had tried the cookies before and kept saying\'blueberry blueberry blueberry\'in my ear. I barely like fruit as it is so the thought of eating blueberries in a cookie just sounded borderline revolting. MaineMan teases me for being the only vegetarian he knows who doesn\'t like vegetables and fruit. After staring at the blackboard for a good solid five minutes and not really registering what was happening I gave in. We went with the blueberry and cream cookie and the compost cookie. These are the only two cookies you\'re allowed to try if you go to Chang\'s Milk Bar. They were soft, gooey, chewy and I wanted to wrap myself in them. Just how a cookie ought to be.\'We\'re not the best cooks,\'Chang once told The New Yorker back in March 2008.\'We\'re not the best restaurant -- if you were a really good cook you wouldn\'t be working here, because really good cooks are a--holes. But we\'re gonna try our best, and that\'s as a team.\'Chang is no bulls--- artist. And his food is no bulls--- either. I don\'t know if I\'ll ever be ready to fight the minions to get into Momofuku Ko, but I am psyched to know I can count on a bar stool at Ssam for brussels sprouts, lardo, a strong cocktail, great service and a warm compost cookie for dessert. Drool indeed. 207 2 Avenue, at 13th St. 212) 254-3500 Worked on this opus for 12 long hours yesterday. I found some great new friends on the Web, while reaching out to some old friends as well. I hope you enjoy these recipes! I\'m seriously rethinking my decision to become a vegetarian after compiling this (but I won\'t, Winette, don\'t fret). I\'m off to sunny Orlando with @Jcole this weekend. Disneyworld we,\'ing, here we come. Until next week, friends. And you can click here for last year\'s rendition for another 10 gluttonous dishes.\'Hey! We\'re going to grab dinner tonight at Choptank. Would you guys like to join? It looks v. yummy, classic B\'more foo,\'dwrote Fashionista.\'Only if you promise the hush puppies will be authentic. I\'m in,\'said BYOWino. Fashionista made reservations for five of us at Choptank, the new Chesapeake Bay-themed restaurant in the west village. She\'s a sucker for anything that says Maryland or crabs so I knew it wouldn\'t be long until we ended up there, whether it was for FTDC or another occasion. My friend Sunkist was visiting from Colorado and I asked Fashionista if we could crash her and JerseyBoy\'s date night at Choptank. Every Friday they are in town they pick a restaurant off Eater\'s 38 (their list of essential New York dining spots). For this place they were making an exception. I wanted Fashionista to meet Sunkist and after a full day of back-to-back dance classes, I knew Sunkist would be up for a good, hearty meal. Sunkist and I went to school together in Charlottesville and we moved to Snowmass, Colo., after 9/11. Sunkist went from being the star of Aspen\'s Crystal Palace to producing her own children\'s plays in Aspen. She is opening up a dance studio as well and part of her goal in coming to New York was to brushen up on some of the hottest trends in dance. I could devote an entire post to our hip hop class at the Ailey Dance Studio , but I\'ll save that humiliation and embarrassment for only my closest friends (and the unlucky passersby who got to watch my sorry butt wiggle and wag in the Ailey fishbowl studio). Unfortunately, Sunkist had a class that night that went until nine. Reservations were at 8:30.\'We can shower at the studio so we can be quick to meet up,\'she texted. I don\'t think Sunkist understood the whole New York reservation situation. I told her we\'d play it by ear, knowing that we\'d probably end up eating and meeting her somewhere after. Little Annie\'s in Aspen may let you hang out and casually wait for friends to arrive, but New York tables didn\'t quite work that way. I\'d already asked Fashionista to change her reservation once and I didn\'t feel like making her do it again. I e-mailed a few friends who I thought would be interested in dinner and we had one taker: BYOWino. Sunkist would join us later after her class and either sit with us or at the bar, depending on the space. I was the first one to show up at Choptank. Since I\'d been the annoying friend adjusting and readjusting our reservation, I was not going to be the annoying late friend. I walked in and felt sort of lost in the overly large empty space at the front for standing, checking in and waiting. There were two high tables with stools on either side of the door by the windows. One couple sat with their Blackberries lit on the table. He would answer, she would stare off into space, he would hang up; she would answer, he would stare off into space, she would hang up. This little dance continued for about 10 minutes. They seemed to be meeting more people like I was, yet they had drinks and I did not. Hmmph. After checking in I sat down opposite them and watched the place in action. The entrance space was straight up awkward. The bar behind the check-in table was a good four or five stairs up from ground level. They should have expanded the bar further towards the window and increased their stool surface area, while decreasing the over-sized pointless space in front. As soon as Fashionista, JerseyBoy and BYOWino arrived, we exchanged hugs, left our tired winter coats with a host and headed off to our table. The main dining area scored high on the cool meter. Choptank was dominated by its two huge square-shaped bars in the mi,\'le of the room. The space with tables (and those who weren\'t cool enough to make the cut at bar seats) seemed like a lame after-thought. If you go to Choptank, eat at the bar. I immediately wished I was meeting one person instead of three so I could sit in front of the bartenders, drink out of a big wine glass and stare at the oysters all night. The place was completely packed, yet somehow we scored the best table in the place - the end table right by the window. The dining area loops around to the left. After you pass the two bars you head down a few stairs again for the five or six tables on ground level. We were big fans of the corkboard on each wall.\'I think we need to come in next time with a photo of all of us and just stick it up there,\'said Fashionista.\'Hells YES! Right in the mi,\'le of all the beach and sand scenes,\'said BYOWino.\'I love this plan,\'I a,\'ed. I hope the wall has since filled up since we visited. It was looking a little sparse. Our waitress came to the table for our drink order. Fashionista and I ordered a couple of cocktails while the boys ordered beers. Our waitress was friendly and mildly attentive, but as sharp as a used piece of chewing gum.\'What happened to the hush puppies? That was one of the reasons I came,\'said BYOWino, half-jokingly, half-serious.\'Well...they had those in the beginning for our soft opening, then the chef must have taken them off the menu.\'Why?\'I have no idea.\'Does the crab chowder have corn in it?\'Fashionista asked.\'I have no idea.\'Do you mind...err... finding out?\'Oh, you want me to find out? OK, sure.\'The cocktails were pretty intense. Mine was the size of a pint-glass and half-filled with ice. Potent. Fashionista\'s came out and I wanted to ask,\'That\'s it?\'It looked awfully silly next to my gargantuan drink. She tasted hers and was unhappy. It was a bit too heavy on the gin and you could barely taste the St. Germain, not to mention it was warm and would have tasted a million times better chilled. I liked mine, mostly for the ginger and huge ice cubes, and would definitely order it again. For starters we tried the crab claws. We tried ordering the crab dip and chips off the menu, but the waitress informed us each table got a complimentary order. This was a nice gesture, but perhaps best to take that off th
Hey kids.. sorry, but you probably won\'t be seeing a post on my Daring Baker challenge this weekend. Unfortunately what I thought was a simple cold has gotten worse and it\'s about kicked my arse. Combine that with work and my procrastination issues and well.. no Tiramisu in my kitchen this month. :( I did buy all the ingredients, so I\'m ready to go in that respect.. just need my nose to dry the freeg up and then figure out a way to assassinate the lil fuckers in my head who are pounding the backs of my eyeballs with sledgehammers. Gah. So we\'ll see.. In the meantime, check out the Daring Bakers blogroll for 1000\'s of creative and beautiful Tiramisu participants.. everyone did (as usual!!) an amazing job with the challenge! Huge hugs to both Deeba and Aparna for being wonderful hostesses this month.. they picked an awesome challenge of making homemade mascarpone and lady finger cookies! From what I\'ve read in our private forums, both of the recipes are delicious! I REALLY want to find out for myself! xoxo I had heard of the croque-monsieur sandwich often in the past year or so.. apparently it\'s making the rounds in the foodie-blog world, since that\'s where I discover many foods I\'d never heard of before. It sounded intriguing, something I might want to try one day, but nothing to a,\' to the MUST MAKE list. I mean seriously, it\'s a grilled ham &amp; cheese sammie. No big whoop. And then I was going through some magazine last week - for the life of me I can\'t remember what it was called - and saw this photo of the most awesome looking sandwich I\'d ever seen. It had a fried egg on top! I don\'t think I\'ve ever spoke of my obsession? fascination? complete and utter GLEE when it comes to the fried egg, specifically the yolk. But there\'s a twist. Yes, I love fried eggs for breakfast (or dinner) with the usual accoutrements - buttered toast, sausage or bacon, hashbrowns, you know.. heart attack on a plate? :) But this obsession - fascination - complete and utter glee that I feel when I see something topped with a friend egg, that normally wouldn\'t be topped with an egg.. I just.. can\'t find the words without sounding gross. Salivate upon seeing oozing yolk is what it is, but frankly, I just grossed myself out by saying that. Salivate and oozing really shouldn\'t be in the same sentence. Hopefully you yolk lovers out there will get where I\'m coming from.. if not.. maybe try to block out what you\'ve just read by closing your eyes tightly and singing LA LA LA LA LA I CAN\'T HEAR YOU MISS GROSS-Y MCGROSSTER extremely loudly until the images go away. :P It was the mental vision of a crispy baked sammie loaded with cheese and that broken yolk oozing (I can\'t stop with the fakkin oozing! Someone give me a better word for crissakes - and don\'t say\'runny\'cuz that squicks me out too!) down the side of it that had me in such a tizz.. hell it could have been a rabbit turd &amp; peat moss sandwich and I would have been drooling all because of that egg. I once saw a salad made of greens, roasted sweet potato chunks and a big old fried egg on top and although I haven\'t made it YET, I still drool over the thought of it. A salad with roasted chunks of sweet potato for crissakes? All because of that ooz glorious fried egg. Anyhoo... As I read the intro to the recipe and realized it was a croque-monsieur with a fried egg thrown on top, the sandwich jettisoned to the MUST MAKE list tout de suite. So I ripped the pages out, brought it home to show hubbs and he agreed, we needed to have this for dinner ASAP. Basically, if ya\'ll haven\'t heard of the croque-monsieur, it\'s ham &amp; cheese (usually gruyËre or emmental) between two slices of bread that have been slathered with a bechamel sauce, and then more cheese on top. It\'s baked until the edges are lightly browned and the cheese is melty and bubbly. Once it comes out of the oven, you slap a fried egg on top to create the croque- madame , throw a nice salad next to it and call it heaven on a plate. I made a few changes to the recipe. I couldn\'t find the jambon de Paris ham it called for, so I used prosciutto. I\'m not a big bechamel sauce by itself kinda gal, so I decided to doctor it up by tossing in a couple generous handfuls of gruyËre (I still had quite a bit left over from the bread ) and just the barest peench of ground mustard. I used a loaf of French miche, which I bought at Panera - miche, I assume, means fakking huge. It\'s a very large square loaf of French bread just perfect for grilling, baking, toasting and of course, making a croque-madame. :) Hubbs made a cucumber, tomato, olive &amp; red onion salad in balsamic vinaigrette to go with and I think that\'s really a must. At least for us.. this sammie is rich, kids. It definitely needs a salad or other light side with it. I had considered frying potatoes &amp; onions, making our dinner more breakfast-like, but am glad that I didn\'t. So who doesn\'t like a ham & cheese sammie, eh? I like them, they are O.K., not my favorite but I\'ve eaten many in my day. Who hasn\'t? Feel about the same way? Kinda meh? Yeah well.. make this kicked up hot ham & cheese sandwich and I doubt you\'ll ever go back to the usual. We were both amazed at how good this was. Admittedly, the prosciutto wasn\'t the right ham. It was too salty, but that still didn\'t take away much from the sandwich in whole. And it was fun to eat a\'gourmet\'hot ham & cheese with a fork & knife! I suppose you could pick it up and eat it as you would any other sammie, but it\'d be kinda messy.. but hey, if that\'s your thing, go for it. ;) I urge you all to go out and buy a good ham that\'s not too salty, a big chunk of gruyËre or emmental (I\'m sure Swiss would be just fine) and a dozen eggs and get to making this for your dinner this week - and then throw it into your rotation every once in a while. It\'s a bit of a splurge both in price and calories, but you won\'t be sorry after you take that first bite. Trust me. SO. FAKKIN. GOOD. Croque Monsieur or Madame Serves 4 For Bechamel sauce: 3 TBS. butter 1/4 c. all-purpose flour 3 c. whole milk (I used fat-free and it came out just fine) Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg Salt & white ground pepper to taste For the sandwiches: 8 slices high-quality bread. (the recipe called for\'Pullman\'loaf, I used French) sliced 1/3 to 1/2 inch thick. 12 oz. thinly sliced jambon de Paris (high quality wet-cured ham, not too salty) 10 oz. GruyËre cheese, coarsely grated 4 whole eggs (for the madame) Over low heat, in a small saucepan, melt butter then whisk in flour until blended. Continue to whisk while pouring in milk to avoid lumps. Continue to cook, stirring constantly until thickened. This should take about 10 minutes. (If you are only making enough for 2 the sauce thickened within 2 minutes) Once thickened, season with nutmeg, salt & pepper. (This is where I a,\'ed a couple handfuls of grated gruyËre and the smallest pinch of ground mustard) Take off heat, set aside. The recipe says you can make the bechamel sauce up to 24 hours early. Place plastic wrap directly on the sauce so it won\'t form a skin, then refrigerate. Gently reheat a few minutes before you are going to use it. Preheat the oven to 400∫ F. Place the 8 slices of bread in a single layer on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper. Spread the bechamel sauce evenly to the edges of all the slices (you may not need all of the bechamel). Divide ham between only 4 slices covered with bechamel, keeping the ham within 1/4 inch of the edges. Top all 8 slices with equal amounts of grated gruyËre cheese, again spreading it evenly within 1/4 inch of the edges. Place the 4 slices with bechamel and cheese (cheese side up!) on top of the slices layered with ham. Bake until cheese topping is melted and golden brown about 10 to 15 minutes (it took about 20 minutes in my oven) To make the croque-madame, fry 4 eggs sunny-side up (I went with over easy, because egg slime is A VERY BAD THING) and place one on top of each sandwich. Sprinkle with salt & pepper and serve immediately. xoxo Kids! I don\'t know what the hell has possessed me, but I\'ve baked. And not for a Daring Baker\'s challenge, either. I baked on my own. WTF? Here\'s what I\'m thinking.. ya\'ll should run out and buy lots of bottled water, saltine crackers, canned goods and toilet paper (never be without toilet paper!!). Dig yourself an underground shelter in the back yard and prepare yourself for some kind of natural disaster. I don\'t bake unless it\'s a DB challenge! Something bad is surely going to happen! And bread! Lord almighty I NEVER bake bread on a whim or on my own - NEVER. This disaster is going to be a doozy   I\'m tellin\' yas! Wait.. don\'t go getting all panic stricken just yet. I still have my usually long ass story to tell. Come back. Sit down. Join me in a glass (or twelve) of your favorite alcoholic beverage.. believe me, it\'ll calm those shaking hands. Or is it just my hands that are shaking? Whatev. Anyhoo, something made me finally bake THIS RECIPE again. Go look. Because if you don\'t go look you won\'t understand what a wonderment this baking adventure was. Seriously. GO. LOOK. Did I lie? Is that not the most frightening things you\'ve ever seen? It\'s like science fiction and pornography combined. And I ate those bad boys. All 4 of them. In like a week. If even. It was the best damn cheesy bread I\'ve ever had and at that juncture in my life I didn\'t think anything could be as good as Panera\'s Asiago bread . But those 4 cheesy baked monstrosities were phenomenal. I kept saying that I would make them again.. but baking is sooooooooo fakking stressful for me. The Baking Gods hate my ever-livin guts. They laugh at me at every occasion. They mock me at the drop of a hat. They sneer and point at me while whispering behind my back. I don\'t know what the fakk I ever did to piss them off, but I obviously did. And now, what? 2 years later? Something possesses me to make them again. I made the starter last Thursday night. I was unsure how far ahead you can make a starter, so I enlisted the advice of my bread baking guru , Mary. She told me I can make it a few days ahead, which eased some pressure as I knew I wanted to make it this weekend, but was unsure of the exact day. HAR! Yeah.. in other words - how long could I procrastinate before my started died and I chickened out? Gah. Well.. come to find out the Baking Gods were watching - AS PER FUCKING USUAL. You see, the recipe calls for instant yeast. I didn\'t even comprehend that.. I used active yeast. So after 15+ hours (I had to work on Friday), it hadn\'t gotten very bubbly and pretty much looked just like a wad of dough. Not good. So I got on the King Arthur website and with an expert. It was immediately pointed out that I used the wrong yeast. Duh. I thanked her and then realized  Baking Gods   1 / Lisa   BIGFATFUCKINGZERO. I didn\'t have instant yeast, so I sweet talked my beloved Hubbs into running out to get me some. Bless his cotton socks. Soon I had the correct yeast and more bread flour. I started again - this time around 6 a.m. Saturday morning. I figured it\'d be good to go around 2ish that afternoon, then I\'d make the dough and allow it to rise until Sunday morning. Way longer than what\'s called for, but I\'ve read that if you let your dough rise for a long time, the better the flavor of the bread.. and hell, any excuse to actually put off baking it. Yeah, the memory of the smoke detector going off and black billowy smoke spewing from my oven the last time I made this bread was pretty damn strong. Well my powers of procrastination are pretty damn.. uhmm.. powerful. I managed to conveniently \'forget\' the starter on Saturday afternoon. And Saturday night. On Sunday morning I remembered it and said to myself, \'Hey dipshit, you need to make the bread today.\' And then I blocked it out again. I had plans with my girlie friends to go shopping at Trader Joe\'s.. and I\'ve been out of Tejava tea for a month. Nectar of the (non-baking) Gods, I tell ya! So my mind was conveniently \'elsewhere\'. :P When I got home Sunday afternoon, I put away the groceries, poured myself a big glass of tea and got the flour out. I was going to make the dough! Go me! Making the dough took roughly 5 minutes. Mmmm hmm  5 whole fakking minutes of my time. A spare 5 minutes that I just couldn\'t seem to find all day Saturday and most of Sunday. You see this is how my mind works. And believe me, I know I ain\'t right. Knowing full well how delicious the bread would end up, I still did everything I could to drag my big fat feet in making it. It\'s like I\'m a glutton for my own punishment. What. The. Freeg? Before I went to bed Sunday night, I punched the dough down because obviously I wasn\'t going to make the bread. Today was a rare morning.. I actually woke up after my husband. That happens maybe twice a year? And I\'m usually sick.. but whatev, I woke up later and the first thing out of his mouth wasn\'t the usual grumble-speak \'mrn\'ng\' or even \'is the princess FINALLY up?\' it was, \'My goodness, doesn\'t that freshly baked bread smell delicious?\' What an ass. This was his way of telling me that the dough had been sitting out far too long and if I was going to bake bread then I better shit or get off the pot. Visual there.. sorry. Moving along.. A lovely collage of basically the same photo of the mini loaves/buns.. -slurp- I finally made my bread today. FOUR days after making the first batch of starter. FOUR. I had made two batches of dough so that I could make the mini \'loaves\' and a couple regular sized loaves. This time I cut the mini loaves much thinner.. and they came out more like bun size, which was perfect. Smaller means that the insides can\'t rise out from the base reminiscent of the alien bursting out of that guy\'s chest. I didn\'t make flaccid geoduck/penis this time. They turned out bakery beautiful! I was AMAZED. I know today is a holiday for us in the US, but uhmm.. is this also a holiday for the Baking Gods? Or did I just take so damn long that I fooled them into believing that I\'d never actually bake the dough?? Either way.. it all turned out great! Even the regular sized loaves, which I was unsure of because I hadn\'t attempted that last time. Today is a day to mark on the books. Today I BEAT THE SHITE out of the Baking Gods. Today I made myself proud. Today something horrible is going to happen.. so really now.. get off your asses and start digging up your back yard. You can thank me for the head\'s up after it\'s all over. ;) xoxo The 2010 February Daring Cooks challenge was hosted by Michele of Veggie Num Nums . Michele chose to challenge everyone to make mezze based on various recipes from Claudia Roden, Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Dugid. This month\'s Daring Cook\'s challenge brought a whole new culture into my life. I\'ve never eaten ANYTHING Mi,\'le Eastern before, although my sister loves it and has been telling me for months that I need to try it. I have to admit, Mi,\'le Eastern fare, never really thrilled me because when I think of that kind of food, I think of beans. -shu,\'er- Chickpeas, lentils, black beans.. all of those lil pasty tastin\' legumes. If you\'re new to this here lil blog, then you might not know of my strong dislike of beans. Frankly, I\'d rather eat live bees. ;) But I am happy to say that I was completely wrong, which is nothing new. :P Yes, Mi,\'le Eastern food does contain beans, but there is so much of a variety of other foods - I had no idea! I wanted my Mezze to be special, so I called upon my home girls. My G\'s, if you will. June, Blimey & Amy - 3 of my favorite people in alla world. As per usual, they were up for it and all agreed to find a Mi,\'le Eastern recipe to bring to the party. Yay! I decided to make a cold Lebanese carrot salad, green beans (one of the few that I\'ll eat) Lebanese style, Kalamata olive tapenade as well as the mandatory hummus and pita bread. June brought a delicious Tabouli and Amy brought a refreshing and really delicious cucumber Raita. Unfortunately, Blimey got sick so she couldn\'t join us, and we missed her tremendously. We piled everything onto the kitchen table and started eating immediately. SO GOOD! My absolute favorite was the green beans Lebanese style. Holy cow, I could eat that daily. I wouldn\'t even share much of the left overs with the gals because I HAD. TO. HAVE. IT. the next night with a roasted chicken. Delish! I really enjoyed the small bites of everything.. and liked to combine different dishes to see what went best with what. My favorite combo was a lil Kalamata tapenade on some pita followed with a lil dab of cucumber Raita. Salty with a nice tang. -slurp- As for cooking this feast - no problems really at all. I got a lil nervous when my pita didn\'t balloon up like Audax\'s and it didn\'t really brown up on top. The bottoms browned up nicely though. And although parts were flat and parts were bubbly it was really good pita. June was the resident Mi,\'le Eastern connoisseur and she said the pita was excellent and she loved the other dishes as well. Score! I know it was good food because I realized afterward that we had no meat and didn\'t even miss it! It wasn\'t consciously planned that way, but since it happened, I\'m going to say we dedicated our vegetarian dinner to Michele. :D Eating this way is definitely fun - true party food. Next I want to do a Tapas night and then a dim sum night.. I\'m looking forward! Michele, thanks so much for turning me on to this delicious food and showing me how easy it is to make pita bread! I\'ll definitely be making it again! You did an excellent job hosting! Love you! Check out all the rest of the amazing Mezze feasts from our Daring Cook troops ! Just seeing what they\'ve uploaded to the forums makes me all kinds of hungry for Mezze all over again! ;) xoxo A few weeks ago, my friend Michele and I were talking about recipes and doughnuts came up, like they eventually always do if you\'re having a conversation with me. :P Ahh yes, I love me my doughnuts. But I won\'t let myself eat them very often. -sigh- I know how bad they are because of their deliciousness. Anything that tastes that good is definitely a heart attack or stroke disguised in fluffy goodness covered in powdery sugar or chocolate. Or maple. Or bacon. Or cinnamon sugar. Or whipped cream. Or just plain for those days when you\'re trying to eat healthy. ;) So we decided that we must make homemade donuts. This past Sunday was D-day. I went with Alton Brown\'s recipe . I was a little nervous because, yanno, Alton can bring in a lil too much science. But the recipe was straightforward, thank the baby Jebus. The only problems I ran into were bad timing and way too hot oil. The timing thing - you need to heat milk to melt the shortening. Then you have to wait until it cools to lukewarm because you\'ll be mixing it with the water/yeast mixture. Well the -first- time I did it, I started to heat my milk and immediately poured my yeast into the lukewarm water, not taking into account that after the milk melts the shortening it\'ll take some time for it to cool off enough to a,\' it to the yeast. Doh! You wouldn\'t believe how fakkin long it takes for hot milk to cool the fug down. Jebus. My yeast/water mixture had already bubbled and was sitting on the bottom of my very cold metal Kitchenaid bowl. If you listened closely enough you could hear their itty bitty teeth chattering and their itsy bitsy knees knockin\'. :( I was blowin\' on the milk.. fanning it with a kitchen towel.. put it in the fridge for 10 minutes.. the bottom of the bowl wouldn\'t cool off. I mean this stuff was HOT. So finally, we (Hubbs was present) decided to put the damn bowl out in a snow drift. I mean, seriously. It\'s not like we were trying to cool off GALLONS of milk.. it was just a cup or so for crissakes, but it wouldn\'t cool down. And no, this had nothing to do with my desire to be eating warm, fluffy, mouth-wateringly, rings of yumminess. Much. \'kay well maybe it had a lot to do with my impatience over having to wait for the prize, but I tell you - that milk was volcano hot. Outside it went. :P Okay well what are two people to do while waiting on milk to cool? They get all caught up in Animal Planet\'s Puppy Bowl VI is what they do. We couldn\'t peel our eyes away from the cuteness if we tried. OHMYGOD. Chubby puppy bellies! Wagging puppy tails! Floppy puppy ears!!! Much more delicious than any doughnut! And when we finally did remember there was molten hot milk sitting in a snow drift on our back deck, this gal jumped up immediately, tripped over her dog, caught herself before completing a full face plant into the arm of the loveseat and then promptly tripped over the blanket she had been cu,\'led under while watching oodles of puppies attacking each other and stuffed footballs. That was more exercise than I\'ve had in weeks. GAH. As you might have guessed, the shortening was no longer liquefied. It sat in greasy lumps in the ICE COLD milk. Mmm hmmm... Meanwhile.. my yeast had passed on to the great bread bakery in the sky. It was a pitiful scene. No bubbles. Just murky muck sitting on the bottom of the bowl. -sigh- So I cleaned up my lil yeasty dead soldiers, put the milk back on the burner until the shortening JUST started to melt. Waited 10 minutes and THEN brought yeast and lukewarm water back together again. After all of that, putting the dough together was a snap. The waiting was the hard part.. at one point I felt like standing in front of the bowl containing the dough ball and screaming\'HURRY THE FAKK UP FOR CRISSAKES!! DOUGHNUTS! HUNGRY! NOM NOM NOM!!!\'Once I had them shaped and rising the last time, I heated my oil in a wok. I knew it was kinda hot, but I didn\'t want a greasy doughnut, so I figured a little hotter than it called for would be a good thing. And it was. Although they came out a little darker than you\'d see in a doughnut shop, they weren\'t burnt or greasy. They were light and fluffy and uber delish. I did a good job of refraining from putting a platter on the table, throwing my hair up into a ponytail, putting my hands behind my back and doing my best impression of a pig feeding in the trough. It was hard though. Delicious homemade doughnuts, still warm and covered in cinnamon sugar.. OH. MY. GOD. SOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD. It\'s super easy to make doughnuts and home and really the waiting isn\'t all that bad - 1.5 hours total rise time is all it calls for. You can make several varieties with one batch of dough and depending on size, you can get quite a few doughnuts. The only way I can describe the size of mine is they were the size of doughnuts you buy prepackaged in a grocery store.. like from Pepperidge Farms if anyone is familiar. I didn\'t have a doughnut cutter, nor even a round cutter. So I used a wine glass and to cut the mi,\'les out, I used the cap of a 2 liter bottle of soda. HAR! Worked like a charm! :) I used the scraps to make twists. We were going to fill some of them, but that didn\'t happen for whatever reason. I know these doughnuts freeze well too. Course I wouldn\'t know that from this experience. I packaged them in freezer bags and left on the counter overnight because it was too dark for photos after they came out of the oil. And after I took photos the next day, I put them back into the bags and then something else caught my attention.. Oh look! A chicken! That night they were pretty much stale. So eat \'em quick or freeze \'em soon! Go check out Michele\'s doughnuts! She filled hers with yummy stuff! :) xoxoxo Okay not really.. but he\'s the only winter Olympian that I know of. And frankly, I\'m not even sure he\'s in the Olympics this year.. is he? What I do know is I like his long wavy red hair. But I probably shouldn\'t say that out loud as I\'m most likely old enough to be his Aunt. -cough- Anyhoo.. as per usual, I\'m a day late and a dollar short. And once again I feel foolish because of it. This month\'s Daring Baker challenge was a breeze and the results were muy deliciouso! Wait, that\'s Spanish.. what would the Canadians say? Uhmm.. \'kay.. well.. the results were KICK ASS! (that\'s more of what I\'d say because I don\'t know what a Canuck would say. Canuck.. is that PC?) The January 2010 Daring Bakers\' challenge was hosted by Lauren of Celiac Teen . Lauren chose Gluten-Free Graham Wafers and Nanaimo Bars as the challenge for the month. The sources she based her recipe on are 101 Cookbooks and www.nanaimo.ca. Lauren is from Canada and these Nanaimo bars are her tribute to the 2010 Winter Olympics held in Vancouver, Canada. Here\'s a funny.. and he\'s probably going to kill me.. but I received an email this morning from my friend John who had to tell me that while he was making his dough for the graham crackers he noticed that it smelled like graham crackers. And then he sai,\'dReally?? You think??.\'Yes Gorgeous, the dough DOES smell like graham crackers and after baked, they taste better than any graham cracker I\'ve ever had. A,\'icting is the word. More like Graham Crack. I kept hearing, er, reading in the forums that other members couldn\'t stop eating the graham crackers and my friend Michele said the same thing - but I had NO. IDEA. HOW. GOOD. they really are. I was almost sad to have to crumble a bunch of them for the Nanaimo bars. Seriously. But I did.. and then I kinda veered off the traditional route and went down my own road. I\'ve made Nanaimo bars before and they were delish, you\'ll get no argument from me there. But they were a leeetle sweet so this time I wanted to make all of the components but in different flavors - specifically flavors that aren\'t as sweet. I started with the graham cracker crust, and omitted the nuts as we can\'t eat them. I also ground the coconut to almost a powder because I had to hide it as Hubbs hates coconut with a passion. He\'ll eat stuff flavored with coconut but hates real coconut. Go figger. And I a,\'ed a generous peench of cinnamon. What I didn\'t do was a,\' the cocoa. This was entirely an accident. I was so intent on grinding down that coconut and getting it into the crust before he came back into the kitchen that I completely forgot the damn cocoa. I really did want a chocolate crust. Then I moved on to the filling, which is what I found too sweet in the traditional bars. I decided I wanted a blast of coffee with the tang of cheese. Ideally I was going to do mascarpone/butter cream frosting flavored with espresso powder. But I never got the chance to get the mascarpone, so I had to do with cream cheese. Basically I made cream cheese frosting sans most of the sugar - I probably used 1/3 of what a basic cream cheese frosting would call for, then thinned it a bit with a boat load of espresso powder stirred into a small amount of hot heavy whipping cream. I can\'t find the words to express how fakking good it turned out and I really can\'t wait to use it on a cake! For the topping, ya\'ll know me, right? I don\'t say no to any kind of chocolate unless it\'s white - which is not chocolate anyways. BUT just a few weeks ago, I made a pan of what is essentially buckeyes (the lil round gobs of delicious sweetened peanut butter dipped in chocolate), but instead of rolling out the peanut butter into balls, because I\'m a lazy mofo, I just spread it into an 8 x 8 pan and poured the chocolate over it. After refrigerating the chocolate became hard (duh) and well.. after forcing myself to eat 3/4 of the pan myself, I was kinda over hard chocolate with something mooshey underneath. :P So I went with a basic ganache over the top of my coffee/cream cheese filling. As you can see in this picture, there is a bite taken. That is the one and only taste of these that I\'ve had (so far) and it took every fiber of restraint in this chubby body of mine to stop there to rush into my office to write this post a day late. And keep in mind, I don\'t own very many restraint fibers. :P Holy mother of a chinless baboon, these bars are FANFARKINGTASTIC. They aren\'t nearly as sweet as the traditional Nanaimo bars, but they are definitely rich, and I\'m confident that I can get over that. :P The cinnamon & coconut in the crust paired with the coffee and chocolate and the tang of the cream cheese is nothing if not heavenly. Lauren, thank you so much for choosing these recipes and for allowing us the creativity to choose different flavors. I just hope I can restrain myself until Saturday evening as I\'ve promised these bars as dessert for friends who are coming over.. but then again if I just whip up another batch, who will be the wiser? ;) Pop on over HERE for the recipes for the grahams (gluten free and made with wheat flour versions) and the traditional Nanaimo bar recipes! xoxo Okay so I can\'t win. I either am stressing to get a Daring Kitchen challenge done at the last minute, or I get it done way early and then something happens where I can\'t get to my lil blog to post on the damn reveal date. WTF? The January 2010 Daring Cooks\' challenge was hosted by Cuppy of Cuppylicious and she chose a delicious Thai-inspired recipe for Pork Satay from the book 1000 Recipes by Martha Day. Huge apologies to Cuppy - I feel as if I have failed our host(s) miserably when I\'m late to get a post up.. this wasn\'t intentional! And now I am seriously pressed for time - but the good news is, there was no disaster this month, so I really don\'t have a long post full of expletives and\'whoa is me\'whining. ;) I made Chicken Satay using Cuppy\'s longer version marinade and it didn\'t even look remotely appetizing as I was transferring my chicken strips (breasts sliced into strips) from the bag of marinade to the broiling pan (grill was under 2 feet of snow..) all yellow and stuff. But I kept an open mind, Lord knows I\'ve been happily surprised often in the past with these Daring Cooks challenges! I had made my peanut sauce earlier due to time constraints and was warming it up again, while the chicken was under the broiler, when it separated. I had a small pan of peanut solid and peanut oil. Ewww. I was very dismayed over it, but thanks to my experience of making buttercream 59 gajillion times, I decided not to panic and to just get out my trusty balloon whisk and start whisking. Luckily it all came together again - only now it was almost like peanut fudge, which isn\'t a bad thing - just something I wouldn\'t normally pair with chicken. ;) Thanks to the amazing support we receive on the private forums of the Daring Kitchen, my question of why it separated was answered by Robert of An Alaskan Cook\'s Exploration of Food and Technique - and he thought that I had too much heat going on. And he was most likely right, I did have the heat up pretty high now that I think of it. Stupid on my part. Again, I persevered and continued on with dinner, making a batch of Basmati rice to go with. Once it was all done, yeah it still didn\'t look that great. My chicken was even more yellow and my sauce was no longer sauce-y. At this point, I could have binned it all and declared it a disaster, but I was HUNGRY dammit. So I plated, called Hubbs to the kitchen and got a giggle from the expression on his face. He was not amused. He must have been hungry too. hehehe I decided to take my dinner into my office so I could watch a movie (and mainly because I wasn\'t in the mood to hear him bitch about how awful the food was). Surprisingly.. this dinner was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I cannot express how much I LURVED it! Suffice to say that it\'s been well over a week since I\'ve made Chicken Satay with Peanut Sauce and a day hasn\'t gone by that I haven\'t craved it. Unfortunately, Hubbs wasn\'t as impressed (most likely because he turns his nose up at any form of chicken. He\'ll eat it but not happily.) and that\'s the only reason I haven\'t cooked this dinner several times since my first taste. But my cravings will win soon - they ALWAYS do - and he\'ll just have to get over it. ;) I always thank our hosts at the end of my posts, but this time I really need to lay on the lurve. Cuppy jumped in when, at the last minute, our slated January host couldn\'t do it. Cuppy had NO TIME and yet she came up with a well written recipe and plan for all diets. This was a quick challenge, that was most gratefully received after the busy and hectic holidays and I now have a new favorite quick meal to throw together after a stressful day at work. And yes, this recipe has been\'westernized\'and is not an authentic Thai recipe, but it\'s delicious regardless. I seriously cannot wait to make it again! Thanks so much, Cuppy!! :) xoxo The December 2009 Daring Bakers\' challenge was brought to you by Anna of Very Small Anna and Y of Lemonpi . They chose to challenge Daring Bakers\' everywhere to bake and assemble a gingerbread house from s
Don\'t call for the sake of calling Never try calling someone working for a company unless you know their full name. Chances that you are going to get through their receptionist are slim: This I learned some weeks ago when I tried to get hold of a marketing manager of a Swedish company based in Shanghai. The receptionist told me \'he\' (that later turned out to be a she!) was out and that she didn\'t know what time \'he\'d\' be back. I tried other people: -Somebody else working with marketing? -Not available. -Some Swedish person working there? -At a business trip. Would be back earliest in 2 months (!). -The manager!? -In a meeting all day. I soon realized it was useless. It didn\'t matter who I asked for  even the cleaning lady was completely unavailable since I didn\'t know her last name. I had two other people calling trying the same thing before we all gave up and decided to call the head office in Sweden. Via them (because there, surprise, surprise, you can actually talk to people when you call!) we got the name of someone working in Beijing, and via the Beijing woman, we finally got the name of the marketing manager in Shanghai. Next time I called I got through straight away. And when I went for a meeting there one day later, I miraculously met several Swedes working away at their desks: - Oh, recently got back from your trip?! I inquired.  -Trip? They said, looking at me as if I was from another planet.  In other words: don\'t try calling someone working over here unless you know their name. The receptionists can be quite tough, working like a spam filter and only letting through those that are \'inside enough\' to know who\'s doing what. I\'m going far away from this kind of scene... Finally, we booked a trip to somewhere... that is totally random! I swear, you guys are going to think I\'m o,\' who\'s travelling to this particular place at this time of the year. It\'s not really the\'ideal\'place to visit, however, I\'m always keen on seeing something completely new, hence why I picked it. Can tell you this much -there will be a lot of nature and hopefully also some pretty awesome (but different) food! Not to mention some severe temperature differences between night and day....! Anyone who can guess where I\'m headed?  UPDATE: for those that cannot be bothered to read the comments, some of you guessed right. I\'m off to Inner Mongolia! Most Wanted Joint I spent Saturday in Suzhou  packing and cleaning. We are definitely staying in China for some time still, but our new Shanghai flat is much smaller than the one we had in Suzhou  so a lot of stuff has to go. After a Saturday full of throwing away stuff we felt fed up with being locked inside and got ready to take the 5.30pm train to Shanghai. We walked out on our yard, carrying large bags, and being quite in a hurry when we saw a group of four Chinese -3 women and one man, with so much hair wax in his hair that it looked like glue- stepping out of a car. - Heeeeey! Laowai, laowai! The wax-man yelled, and we, thinking it was just the ordinary \'hello laowai\' moment, continued walking without paying them any attention. ..That was until I su,\'enly heard the wax man literally call for us. - Please wait laowai, I have a question! We turned around, facing the wax man and three older ladies. - You live in that building over there right? The man said, pointing at our building. -Yes. -And you are moving out very soon? -Yes. -That\'s what I thought. So today I brought this 3 ladies to show them your flat! He proudly gestured to three small ladies at his right side. - Ehhh  -Can we go and see it now!? One lady asked. - Er, we are going to Shanghai, I said, no,\'ing towards my large shoulder bag. - Ah OK   said the man. But can\'t you show us the flat before you go? -We don\'t have time! We are catching the train. -Oh  no time . The wax man sounded seriously disappointed. - What time is your train , one of the women said. I am sure you have time to show us the flat before that. -The train is leaving quite soon, we have to go now actually, I said. We don\'t have time to show you our flat (\'How about calling first?!\' I wanted to screem). -That is a shame, the wax man said, looking at us as if we were enemies. So when will you be back then?! (Just as if we had broken a non-existent appointment?!) - Well  we are  ah, why don\'t you just call me next time?! My bf said.  - Ah.. OK. You want me to call you. I understand, the wax man said. -A re you sure you don\'t have time to show us the flat? One of the ladies urged. You will still make your train. It\'s fast to get to the train station from here! They all smiled, and one of them attempted to pull my sleeve. I gave her a dark look. Enough with the bull-sh-t. And we left. Just imagine that, huh? You take three ladies on a house hunt on a Saturday afternoon, however, you forget to inform the current tenants, so instead you jump on the first laowais you see on a parking lot?! (our living area is huge, there are at least 40 buildings in there!). Fortunately they are the \'right ones.\' Then you try and convince them to show you their flat even though you know they\'ll miss their train if they linger?! If that\'s not random I don\'t know what is?! One would think this was a serious aerobic class in full throttle. And I guess it was. But not for everyone: Apparently, the aerobic class, with bom-ba-da-bom-tunes blasting from the speakers, was also a perfect place for reading a book! Who would have guessed?! Not me, anyway.  When I say I need a run, I mean it I\'ve had a bit of a rough week, with a lot of stuff going on, making my mood anything but stable. Yesterday I decided that no matter how much work there was on my desk by the end of the day, I would still hit the gym in order to burn some energy. I kept my promise  but just as I was about to leave for the gym a strange feeling hit me.. Did I really pack all my training clothes? I decided to have a look, and very well. I had packed all my training clothes, except for a sport\'s bra. There\'s no way (on earth) that I will hit a gym wearing a normal bra, so the remaining question was: could I bother going home, picking up a sport\'s bra, and then head back to the gym? (It\'s definitely not on the way, rather, I live in the opposite direction) However, after a moment of mental self-consulting, I decided that I very well could. So I went home, found what I needed, spent extra time on a crammed metro and arrived at the gym one hout later than planned, but hyped about the thought of hitting the treadmill. I had dinner plans at 8pm, so I went over to the reception and asked to \'rent\' a towel a 5 kuai so that I could shower and head out straight after my workout. Imagine my surprise when the (RUDE!) guy behind the desk said: -No towels today. If it would have been any other day I might have shrugged my shoulders and left, slightly annoyed. This particular day, however, his words made me see red. -That\'s IMPOSSIBLE! That\'s not OKAY! I need a towel. I NEED TO WORK OUT! (again, I normally don\'t yell at people, but ) - Well sorry, we don\'t have any. -No, this is not okay. You always have towels. If you su,\'enly decide not to have towels you need to inform your customers in advance so that we can bring some ourselves! I didn\'t bring a towel today just because I thought I could \'rent\' one from here! -Well  -Well you have to find me a towel. I am not leaving. I need a towel otherwise I cannot workout. -Eh.. maybe you should speak to the manager? -Yeah, where is he or she? -Eh  he will come in 3 min. I waited for 3 minutes, feeling angrier by the minute. I simply refused to just go home.  The reception guy was really annoying: - I know this situation is really annoying  (he said it in a sarcastic way). - VERY. -Why don\'t you go and workout first, have a shower and THEN come and see if we have found you a towel? -WHAT?! How am I going to shower without a towel?! ( I wanted to say\'do you want me to walk out naked and ask if you have now found me a towel?!\'but I don\'t know the Chinese word for naked, so I left it like that) (I guess his suggestion here was:\'why don\'t you do like all the other girls at this gym and dry yourself off with the hairdryer once you come out of the shower\'). Then, 2 girls su,\'enly arrived (manager?). The reception guy told the girls they needed to find \'this laowai\' (pointing at me) a towel. - There are no towels , the girls said. - There HAVE to be towels! I know there are, somewhere! I don\'t care what kind, you just have to find me a towel! -But there are no! -Please. Try! The girls sighed, rolled her eyes and went away, only to come back 30 seconds later . Carrying a LARGE, WHITE, TOWEL! - Oh, I found one. Oh my, oh my. At that point, however, I was too relieved to continue bitching about their lousy attitude towards problem solving, I simply accepted the towel and went to the ladies changing room. Once at the gym all the treadmills were busy. However, I didn\'t even consider the thought of giving up this workout, or settling for anything else but running. I simply located a girl who was walking along to a clock ticking down (she only had 4 min left), and I was rude enough to stand behind her and wait for her to finish and get off. A number of people realized what I was doing. Some laughed, some pointed, and some tried to sneak in between when they realized the girl would be done soon! But I was faster and once I got up there I enjoyed the best 7km run I\'ve done in ages  ahhhh. Relieeeeeef! Once I made that 8pm dinner I felt rather proud of myself and my  nagging-attitude. If there\'s a will there\'s a way  this appeals to most of the \'impossible to solve \'-situations in China. It\'s not as if I have not been told that I\'cannot run\'before...  A captured metro moment from 2007 Fellow metro-commuters in Shanghai, have you noticed lately (at least during the morning rush) that more and more people nowadays stand on the right hand side of escalators?! That way, it\'s almost as efficient ( Hold your horses, I said almost ) as the London underground system (where I believe you stand to the left, but I might be wrong?) where you literally get walked over if you accidently stand on the \'walking hand side\' of the escalator. Of course, there are still a few cases of people (OK, not just a few, more like  some millions) standing on the left hand side when you come walking, but with a gentle push/tap on the shoulder, a good 90% immediately move to the side to let you through. Good stuff.  Unfortunately not all people are as friendly/helpful. I\'ve had cases where I\'ve gently tapped the other person\'s shoulder (in 98% of the cases it\'s been mi,\'le-aged Chinese men), and said something like \'?????bu haoyisi= pardon me)\' indicating I want to be let through. But do they move? Oh no?! In one case, the man turned around, looked at me, and stood like a brick of stone on his spot, refusing to even let me squeeze between him and that person to the right. (When he started pushing me back with violence I decided to give up). Still, a great improvement from previous years, so Shanghai metro  I have hope! One thing I still wish people could relax a little bit about is getting on/off the metro. The other day we had a work-dinner after work, and me and a few colleagues caught the metro just one stop to get to the restaurant. We were a group of five, and since the metro was quite full we stood just at the door. I immediately felt the push from behind, some guy that tried to squeeze in between us to stand JUST at the door, so I turned around and told him that we too were getting off at the next station. He looked like he understood, and for a short second he stood back  until something must have hit him (maybe that eagerness to STAND at the DOOR) so he still decided to elbow his way through our little group and catch the spot JUST at the door. (Guess he\'d been taught never to trust laowais?). The funniest cases are still all those people that push like mad in the metro, RUN off the metro as if their houses were on fire, and then, finally, when they get to the escalator  they just stand there, rather than continuing moving upwards. Speaking off the metro  Shanghai\'s new metro system (with new lines and plenty of new stations) is simply G-R-E-A-T N-E-W-S-! I\'m loving every little bit of it, especially line 7 that\'s now connected to Line 1\'s Changshu Lu. Simply great. Me and my significant other are planning a metro-exploring weekend someday in April/May (when you don\'t freeze your fingers off every time you step out the door) where we are going to spend 2 days catching all new lines, getting off at stops we\'ve never heard off before and explore the surrounding. We used to do this at the magazine where I worked back in 2007, and it\'s not as bad as it sounds... you actually get to see quite a lot of new stuff. I promise to report back to you afterwards. Whatever you do -as a girl- only pay attention to the guys Sometimes, China\'s just so funny. While western guys can receive an unlimited amount of compliments over here (from men as well as from women), there\'s a clear line when it comes to women. The other day I went shopping with four Chinese girlfriends. We are not super close, but have known each other for some years still. They are all a bit younger than me, and especially one of them (her name is Luna) really likes me and the fact that I\'m tall, blonde, and big-nosed. We went into some shops and were all trying on clothes. I had one of those good (and rare) days when everything fits, and my dear friend Luna simply would not hold back on the compliments: -Ah, Jonna, you look so great in everything you try on today! -That\'s perfect on you! -You\'ve got a great figure! I was blushing/\'nail-nali-ing\'/\'bu gandang-ing\'/and so on (yeah, accepting a compliment is simply not my thing, especially not here in China) until one of the other Chinese girls decided she\'d had enough: - What\'s the matter with you Luna, the way you speak to Jonna one would think you have a crush on her?! -Come on  I\'m just saying she looks good in this dress. -No you\'re not. I think you like her.  -Yeah, I think you do! Another one filled in. You\'ve been speaking to her as if you like her all day long! (Yikes. Uncomfortable situation number ONE. Chinese girls are fighting over if one of them has a crush on me or not?! And all she did was paying me some compliments?) -I don\'t, come on. -Well, so how come you don\'t have a boyfriend. -I have not found one I like. -Well maybe you like girls. Maybe you have a big problem  -Hahhaha, well well, shall we all go for lunch?! (I decided it was time to step in and change the subject -and what better way to do so than distract them with lunch?). However, the conversations continued over the food when Luna asked me if I wanted to try her salmon pasta (we were having a Wagas lunch). -Seeeeeeeeee .. you totally like her!!! You\'ve got a problem! You like girls! Both me and Luna sighed. Man! There\'s no way to get a compliment over here, is there? What a weekend! Since I\'ve now been living in Shanghai for 2 months, we decided that it was time to throw a small housewarming party. Now, housewarming parties are not really a unique kind, so in order to do something different we decided to have a theme at our party, namely \'bad taste.\' Shopping proved to be the best part of it all. We headed straight to the small shops on Fuxing Lu where I tried on everything from flower-power pants to zebra meets leopard dresses. I eventually settled for a skintight golden/leopard shirt, a high-waist black/gold skirt, and a silver/snakeskin jacket that was way too small for me. All in all: I looked like jungle girl going disco. My bf picked his outfit from another shop. We knew straight away that it was going to be fun, because the moment we walked in, the sale\'s girl went ballistic. - OH MY GOSH!!! You are the most handsome man I have ever seen! She gushed to my boyfriend. She followed him around, stroking his arms, giggling and picking out stuff for him to try. She had no idea that we were going for something rather tacky (and that we therefore actually kind of liked the stuff she picked), and said \'yeeeeeeees!\' and \'perfect \' to every single shiny garment that he agreed on trying on. In the end he went for a gray, silver sequence suit jacket, a check-patterned hat, a tight t-shirt and some golden jewellery chains. He looked like a complete yuppie and the sale\'s girl looked like she was going to pass out on the spot: - Oh my Gosh! You look SO GOOD!! (We laughed so hard we didn\'t know what to do!). While he was paying, the sale\'s girl turned to me: - Is he your boyfriend? -Yes. -Oh my GOSH! You are so lucky! SO LUCKY! I admire you! -He\'s indeed very popular in China. -Well, he is the most handsome man I have seen! And you ..! You too are very  . (long look at me) special! -Special? -Yes, in fact. I like the both of you! -That\'s nice of you to say. -I love your nose! -My nose? (small moment of hesitation). -It\'s the biggest and most beautiful nose I have ever seen! (I had to bite my lip not to have an uncontrolled laugh fit) -Ehum, right. Eh  thanks! She waved goodbye when we left, opening the door and yelling: - Come back soon! You are my favourite laowai couple!!! After us. We were high on laughter as we hit the streets. The party itself was a blast, despite an insane number of strange cancellations from our friends: 2 girls confessed they were preggers and couldn\'t make it, one guy confessed his girlfriend was preggers and that he was going to Korea to get married (!), one girl had to work, another one thought it was raining too hard outside ( ), and then one guy broke his arm in an ice-hockey game the night before?! Hahaha! We still managed to pull a crowd, however, and ended up having a great time. People had really made an effort and one guy actually showed up in a dinosaur costume. My boyfriend was a hit in his pimp-outfit, meanwhile my Chinese girlfriends expressed their disappointment in me: -Jonna, you actually look good in those clothes. I would totally wear that on a night out!! Go out as the golden meets silver jungle-disco girl?! (well I shouldn\'t say too much  because that\'s exactly what I did some drinks later). I guess our taste levels are different! Bad taste party calls for bad taste-snacks: we picked these up at our local bakery Mmmm, green bean bun anyone?!
Just as the SNL offshoot , Waynes\'s World , brought out Fre,\'ie Mercury and Queen freshly remastered for Generation Next to make their own, so too does Hotel Chevalier , the thirteen minute outtake and/or prequel from from Wes Anderson\'s new movie , The Darjeeling Limited , bring us back to 1969 and Peter Sarstedt \'s London megahit of that year, Where Do You Go To My Lovely ? with digitized and remastered immediacy Peter Sarstedt was born in Delhi, and spent his infancy in Kurseong at the foot of the Himalayas, at a tea garden where his father worked, and was therefore a real Indian-Anglo-Indian, obviously more privileged than the folks depicted in Bow Barracks Forever -- since his parents chose to leave for England in 1954, a few years into Independence, like other Anglo-Indians who believed the end of the British Empire would bring them harm and left in numbers for Australia and Canada as well as England through the sixties-- but they really were of Indian blood nevertheless. Wes Anderson must have learned about this while making The Darjeeling Limited , because it was a hi,\'en factoid in 1969 that would have earned Sarstedt wild fans in India, but at the expense of his following in England. It only surfaces now , when India is on a roll and all that doesn\'t matter so much any more, but is still not seen on his own web site. It\'s easy to see in these less hairy days that he is Indian, and I wonder how acknowledging that will play out. In 1969. of course, I had no idea Peter Sarstedt was Anglo-Indian, and would have counted him less hip and more Cliff Richard if I had. But I was struck then, no doubt like everyone else, by his crisp and easy delivery of the franglais back and forth lyrics, the clarity evident even through the fuzzy recordings of the day. I had no idea who Zizi Jeanmaire was, nor how to spell her name, nor even for that matter who her husband, the great choreographer Roland Petit was, but I had heard Sacha Distel \'s cover of Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head, did know that Kar?m al-Hussayn?, Aga Khan IV , was gorgeous as well as being the astonishingly wealthy leader of all Shia Muslims, that the Dowager Begum Aga Khan always wore saris, and last, but by no means least, that it was as cool to wear Balmain as to keep your Rolling Stones records at a swank a,\'ress, nothing to do with the Beatles, much as one might love them. Hotel Chevalier is famously available for free download at the iTunes Store , and so represents new and adventurous thinking in movie marketing as well as being a vehicle for reintroducing a worthy megahit of the 60\'s. As it happens, I went to the first ever, high-octane SAMMA conference this weekend, and Nusrat Durrani , SVP at MTV Networks, was one of the stellar presenters at the dinner reception, along with Aasif Mandvi . After dinner and outstanding performances , during which Nusrat Durrani showed a pastiche of his clips from the New York Marathon set to Pink Floyd\'s Breathe , I couldn\'t resist asking him if he had a,\'ed Pink Floyd because they had been signed by Bhaskar Menon . He said no, he just likes them. But it turned out he hadn\'t heard about Peter Sarstedt being Indian-- so I hope something will come of that, because in these times, it\'s well to celebrate another Desi, in disguise for too long. an excerpt from Roland Petit\'s Le_jeune_homme_et_la_mort I missed the afternoon per- formance at the National Museum of the American Indian , but in the evening. I saw the most magnificent production of hula I have ever seen. The San Francisco dance company, N? Lei Hulu I Ka W?kiu , delighted a huge audience at Damrosch Park in Lincoln Center. I\'ll mostly let Lin Cariffe \'s pictures of other performances of the same works speak for themselves. Kumu Patrick Makuak?ne is such a fabulous presenter as well as a mesmerizing choreographer that he brings the audience right into the show while the show itself plays sensuality, thought and feeling with equal command and force. Lihau Hannahs and Kellen Paik provided highly evocative live music for the spectacular production, with thirty-two magnificently costumed dancers, who mixed presentations of traditional legends and tributes with two pieces of piercing satire and several touching, graceful modern pieces, including two set to Annie Lenox and Cyndi Lauper\'s most wistful songs, a brilliant capture of Peggy Lee\'s Fever , and a somehow heartrending interpretation of Tony Bennet\'s version of I Left My Heart in San Franscisco , with its illustrative gestures for\'little cable cars\'and\'halfway to the stars\'-- among other phrases -- casually revealing quite exactly what hula is about. A man seated in the row behind me shouted out frantically that he couldn\'t see, and at least twenty people turned around to shush him, pleading with him not to spoil it for everyone, so swept up was the audience with the gentle but powerful grace and great wit of the show. Antonioni\'s\'achingly hip\'Blow-Up FASHION SHOOT VERUSCHKA YARDBIRDS JANE BIRKIN TENNIS TRAILER (VANESSA REDGRAVE) Obits: BBC New York Daily News Al Jazeera The Montreal Gazette timesonline Indian Express Telegraph. UK Xinhua.net Yesterday, after dropping off Bear at JFK -- and being totally unaware that the Virgin Atlantic plane she had boarded was slated to stall on the tarmac for four hours, waiting for that evening\'s series of short storms to pass, and then take off without most of the food on the menu for passengers on the flight to London--I drove around aimlessly for a while, like anyone deprived of their young might, and decided to check in at the proudly independent Art Space still known as Galapagos . There, the twenty-and-now-early-thirty-somethings still milled and jostled, partying hard without ever lighting a cigarette, because, as Director Robert Elmes has correctly sai,\'dWe have our whole lives to live and that is terribly important.\'The reflecting pool at the entrance is limpid and surprising as ever, but as Galapagos has prospered, it will be moving quite soon from Williamsburg to DUMBO. I considered Lillian Godchaux\'s Solstice VII, which was going on inside the storied Back Room, and had been described by Lillian herself as\'A night of LSD and Native American freak-out driven folk and SF-based soary acid folk in hither, wildering, and bewonderment of this great Solstice VII of the New Water/Matter Era.\'But I was curious about AVAAZ, the act scheduled to appear on the Main Stage, so I missed Almaden , Zachary Cale and Feral Cat . Instead, I spent the same $7 and one extra $ on two under- priced drinks at the candle-lit bar, especially to watch some of the members of AVAAZ (not to be confused with Avaaz.org ) setting up their fast-rising electroGLOBALdiscotek . T aking in their sleek looks, I wondered if they all had gone to MIT and now have day jobs at investment banks-- not that there\'s anything wrong with that. The best version of Sea had just opened down the street when I first saw Galapagos . I had gone to N Sixth Street back then entirely because Dave Eggers and McSweeney\'s held their first and earliest New York events in the now fabled Back Room, while they were reinventing fiction and food , hilarity and social awareness all at the same time. They turned writing into performance art as well -- right there at Galapagos, where I recall a gentleman in his nineties telling a tale of death and playground slides to the sound of helpless yet respectfully muffled laughter-- and n ow they need our help getting past their distributor Publisher\'s Group West\'s bankruptcy, by reason of which they are su,\'enly out $130K in one fell swoop. Say it isn\'t so... They are making a valiant effort with their online sales of all manner of items McSweeney and also with their\'Heartbreaking eBay Auction of Staggering Audacity\'... I pondered this tale of swinging through the ages by a length of tooth floss, and drank two drinks one after another as images of something like starlight played on the blue velvet curtains. These were soon drawn back for the laser light show streamed through whirling stencils in many-colored beams by dimmSummer , and young Pat Miscellane ous , bare-chested in chinos and a full dress, full length Cheyenne headpiece started rapping through the hai-chai remix that DJ Boo (aka Juggaknots) and I believe Bollygirl DK also had started up together. This was with and sometimes without a duet from--? Samera? Reena?. Then came DJ impala\'s entr\'acte, and she played September , Billie Jean , Kiss , and just a few minutes of the long version of Marvin Gaye\'s Gotta Give it Up , but stopped while people had just started moving to this party-song-to-end-all-party-songs, to move on to Patti Labelle\'s original version of Lady Marmalade . How long ago it seems and yet not so far away at all. Mean while, silhouettes danced on the once again starlit velvet curtains, and cellphones flashed as taking pictures became general. Then came all-Desi recently schooled Bamboo Shoots , who are a really good, very special band that somehow brings the lead, rhythm and bass guitar plus drums format into the present moment. They were reviewed on Sepia Mutiny and played on Conan . Strangely, it was the Cold War era movie playing on the screen behind them that distracted, and because I\'m not of the three screen generation, I spent at least fifteen minutes growing older trying to figure out who was who in black and white in Juliet of the Spirits . And then I had to go home while the band played on... and go to sleep, missing Butterthief and Suspicious Brown... The movie\'s called Evening , and if there\'s only one film that people who think too much and feel quite a lot and like to be slightly but deeply scared should see this summer, this is it. AL invited me to the Walter Reade Theater preview, where Susan Minot and Michael Cunningham showed up after the screening to discuss their experience in co-writing the screenplay adapted from the book with Kent Jones, the man with a light touch from the Film Society of Lincoln Center . Throughout the screening, I wondered about the marvelous filter effects on the dream sequences-- how they came on so wonderfully strong and obvious, then tapered off so gradually through the course of the story. Were they in the lens or a part of the editing? Faces were so closely imaged at the start of the story, and with so much particularity, that their natural asymmetry led the eye beyond conven- tional judgments about beauty, although every actor was stunning by any measure. One had to look afresh at already famous faces, that then grew familiar very quickly in these new forms. The casting is as superb as the cast. Of course, but of course, Glenn Close was Meryl Streep\'s mother in another life! Speaking of measurements, Vanessa Redgrave\'s acting must be measured by the frame, not by seconds. That\'s how close up the view becomes in this unsentimental yet touching study of two deaths in played out counterpoint. While Redgrave certainly carries it, all the others absolutely rise to the occasion. Having seen and heard my own grandmother apparently having good time at a fair number of parties on her near-deathbed, I found that this tale resonated with me, and the telling of it, its production, seemed to create a convincing experience of the swing between over- whelming wooziness and diamond hard clarity in the course of that personal time travel and that wandering out of body that heralds a slow death. Drawing away, the big picture of the society that provides the setting for this surprising story is delivered au point as well. While the circumstances of the wealthy family seems casually depicted, there is an uncanny conveyance of how things are proportioned for the rich. The we,\'ing is generously informal and correct, not ostentatious, and the bride\'s dress is not overly grand. This is how it has to be, in a summer setting among people who enjoy extreme cleanliness, rely on slightly stodgy design, established standards of comfort, consuming both hand made and manu- factured goods of quality, and who take proper care of inherited objects as a matter of course. Yet there is also a clear sense of the perilous crowding and living cheek by jowl that imprisons the rich or aristocratic or patrician. Their circles must always be suffocatingly small, the more so the richer or better-established they are, and marriage and even preferred forms of adultery must occur within that small closed circle. The comedy of homosexuality in these narrow straits raises its suggestive head several times in the film. Sometimes it happens mistakenly, as when the mother of the bride happens upon her daughter sharing her we,\'ing morning jitters with her college friend and bridesmaid who has crept under the covers. Pshaw! Sometimes it arises unawares, but for real, as when that same bride\'s mother snatches away her son from his partner during a playful jitterbug for a masterfully bone-chilling rhumba, purposefully extinguishing any possibility of his attachment to another woman. Ouch! These people are not incorrectly depicted as being stifled or inhibited, though. There is nothing in recent film to compare with Glen Close\'s raw howl over Bu,\'y\'s su,\'en young death. There is faerie magic in the woods, but also there are different ways of seeing and treating a small cliff or those same woods, either as the border area between manicured grounds and Vast, Unknown, Dangerous Nature, or simply as perfectly familiar bits of the family\'s property. Playing off the difference in perspectives in a practical joke provides a bit of class-conflict that erupts into rage. Alcohol always plays a leading role in Susan Minot\'s books. In making Bu,\'y a far more central figure in the film than he is in the book, Michael Cunningham ties this story closer to the rest of Susan Minot\'s work. The two writers, live four blocks apart in NYC but quite naturally met at a we,\'ing in Nairobi soon after SM had recovered the rights to her book after an earlier attempt to turn it into a movie. Despite their close collaboration (SM said the collaborative process with MC had been like a master class in screenwriting), they differed on several points. For instance, MC believes a book is always a work in progress, the print capturing only a moment in the process, whereas SM says a printed volume in your hand is a clear indication of completion and enables the writer to let it go. MC said that film cannot capture an inner life as well a a book, but SM pointed out that one\'s inner life occurs in images, not words. But then, they spoke of shared delights in the making of the film, like watching Meryl Streep and Vanessa Redgrave on a monitor outside the house, and being amazed to see them step into character and switch it on, discarding their natural selves in a flash. They talked about filming at a Newport house of that genre known as a\'cottage\'that belongs to the Cushing family, rather than in Maine, as in the book, which would have proven overwhelmingly expensive to produce. They concurred on the problem of turning an entire book into a movie, where films are really short stories, and the more sympathetic form for adapting a novel into image format is a television series. MC spoke fondly of squabbling with cinematographer and director Lajos Koltai over lines about which he had second thoughts, but that Koltai wanted to keep. SM spoke about about Eileen Atkins having trouble with the cadence of the lines until SM explained that the nurse was Irish. They both spoke of Hugh Dancy\'s out of period long hair, and that Lajos Koltai had predicted that critics would be all about his hair. We shall see. I was walking down 82nd Street day before yesteday, late in the afternoon, and realized that I had missed this year\'s Kips Bay Show House , which was being dismantled. Volunteering there had been one of my favorite\'rites\'of Spring for longer than I care to admit, but it\'s been more than seven years since I turned my attention to another event that raises funds for the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club. The Show House I missed was hosted by the brilliant Janna Bullock and RIGroup . This was a very different undertaking from what it once was, when I was one of a band of perhaps twenty young women who took turns watching the rooms under the auspices of the original Show House Committee. The Committee never changed from year to year, but were always there from dawn till dusk, in Chanel suits and ropes of pearls, fresh as proverbial daisies, and well into their seventies-- or so it seemed to me. The air was always scented with Rigaud candles and flowers, which competed with paint and varnish that was not yet cured. There were fads for peonies one year, orchids the next, and air plants another. One had to know what the antiques and paint finishes were, to explain them to visitors, and and make sure nobody fainted from climbing the stairs, as all the terrible things that can happen on elevators weren\'t covered in the insurance contracts. Once, Mrs. Mazzola decided to climb to the top and work her way down, and had to sit down at the top floor landing, which called for procedures reserved for extreme emergencies, in terms of the arrangements of those days. Luckily, a Chinese garden stool came in handy until a proper chair could be brought. Climbing the beautiful staircases two and three steps at a time was a special treat for me, and the main reason I always went back. I was new to New York, and missed staircases, especially those massive marble ones with low risers in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century houses of my hometown, Calcutta , on which one could jump about and play games. Between chasing up and down these newer but equally generous staircases, I enjoyed the fact that the visitors were colorful, international, dressed up, and wore great shoes. My first happy moment of extra responsibility came one year in the first and grandest house, which was on 66th Street and belonged at the time to Imelda Marcos, who lent it every year for the Show House. In the main drawing room situated on the second floor, as in a piano nobile, Robert Metzger had set up an early multi-channel music system around the edges of the room which featured a lush, over-the-top eighties version of period decor, with plenty of silk damask and passementerie, the console being cleverly tucked away, iirc, in cabinet with Boulle marquetry or similar. I was required to stand by a massive flower arrangement on a round table in the center of the room under a magnificent Russian chandelier, smile at visitors and explain the rug, and I noticed that both speakers deployed to the west were playing the same channel, as were the ones to the east. To my enormous delight, RM allowed me to pull out the console after the House closed for the day, fi,\'le with the wiring and fix it. That would never be done today, as the firms who do the sound would, first of all, never make that kind of mistake, and the House would certainly never allow a volunteer to touch the wiring. A few years later, at the first Show House at 603 Park, also the last chaired by the legendary Rella MacDougall , I got to be her right hand gal at the entrance, where she handled tickets herself every day, transforming that job into a subtle performance that required her great wit. That year, the pantry, with its green-shaded light, big silver safe and humongous ancient icebox, was just cleaned up, because the idea was still only to present a decorated house, and the pantry was a perfect relic. One day, during that run, Mrs. MacDougall was hurrying to the Show House when a bag lady. as we called them then, stopped her to ask for help. Rella, being as warm-hearted as she was elegant, asked what she could do for her. The bag lady sai,\'dCould you hold up this mirror for me?\'and while Rella did that, the bag lady rummaged about her shopping bag, drew out and carefully put on a set of big false lashes. The house at 603 Park is one room deep but quite wide, with a long, long Park Avenue facade, and commensurate taxes, so it stayed on the market for a long time, to become the default Show House for Kips Bay and other causes for some years. Thierry DËspont created a memorable decor in the paneled room there, but I can\'t remember whether it was for Kips Bay or the American Hospital in Paris. Although pictures of rooms from recent years are available online now, rooms that came before live only in one\'s memories and in the old journals-- a stack of which were lost to me in a heist upstate, in which I lost about a thousand books as well. What remains in my head: Mark Hampton\'s cream, white and sisal drawing room on 66th Street, with the bureau plat placed like a sofa table, in which all the fine Georgian mahogany became beautifully abstracted; The grand yet hilarious dining room that Ruben de Saavedra created at 62nd Street, where the fabric hung walls were drawn aside at mirrored intervals, for busts of laughing moors to peek out; Richard Ridge\'s almost completely lavender bedroom, which a band of his friends left in a group, all crying out,\'Nurse!\'; the narrow room at 1 East 94th Street that J. Allen Murphy dressed in yellow and Benarasi gold brocade, including an unraveled paghri as a pelmet, hung with Mughal lanterns, which he dedicated to the Raj Mata of Jaipur. She came to look, and I was embarrassed to see her at Doubles while I was still wearing a dress from volunteering (so un-Indian and deeply frowned upon then, though pants were fine); Richard Ridge\'s dining room in which the Romney had been cleaned to within a micron of its life; the large bedroom that John Saladino turned into a frescoed bathroom with a brass punkhah, so insulted was he not to have gotten a drawing room, according to my friend who used to work for him. Recent memorable rooms include Odile de Schietere\'s Venetian drawing room with furniture from FerriËres , Michael Simon\'s dix-huitiËme in black, the cleanest stable in creation by Andrew Tedesco , Larry Laslo\'s black bedroom where the black Baccarat chandelier made its New York dÈbut,... Diantha Nype was another reason I was there. Diantha had left Bryn Mawr to get married, which is like leaving Hogwarts to become a muggle, but then she out-Mawr-ed everybody by inventing the Show House-- it really was her idea to start with, although this will remain forever unsung, because it\'s totally not the credo to claim this kind of credit, considering how many other people have worked long and hard to make it happen. Nevertheless, start it she did, and so all show houses that exist, sprouting across the nation every spring and fall -- to Diantha we owe this most excellent concept. Of all the original Committee, it was she who was always second in command to Rella, she who a,\'ressed the robbery and she who created the public image of the Show House, as it is, was and ever shall be. Anyway, having missed the new Show House, and missing the brio of the old days, it was a very happy touch of deja vue to see what Matthew Sudock of M Design has done at David Burke & Donatella , where I met C for lunch. The mix of Hicks in carpet and screens, with creamy walls, plain mirrors, backlit red dry arrangement, large and loopy chandeliers, cheery cherry leather seating and gigantic bouquets of red-and white striped trumpet lilies , all scaled for a nice tall New York brownstone, reminded me of the panache, the hint of improv and inventive flair of the old days. The food is great , and playful too, and the tuna and salmon tartare not to be missed English-speaking people who are deaf to aspirates and aspirated consonants in Indian languages can\'t say ghee , and tend to produce incorrect spellings like Ghandi and Dehli. Because of this speech impediment, the word sipahi , meaning soldier in Persian and Urdu, became sepoy for the British, who gave this misheard word currency by giving the Indian uprising of 1857 against themselves a misleading nickname --The Sepoy Mutiny. The Uprising involved not only huge numbers of mercenary Indian soldiers under British pay and command, but also Indian princes, their subjects of various classes, their armies and camp followers, the peasantry of those parts of the Gangetic plain then under direct British control , tribal peoples of the Himalayan foothills and Northern plains and motley others. By simplifying the facts, the spin machine of the British Empire was able to promote the idea nearly unimpeded for well over a hundred years that it was all a matter of animal grease (beef and pork tallow) needed to insert rounds into Enfield rifles. How this single matter was supposed to have offended both Hindus and Muslims so much as to give rise to the events of a whole year, in which Indian soldiers and civilians massacred British men, women and children, burned down their dwellings and destroyed key installations of the colonial administration is quite a mystery. Apparently, at that time in England, a popular supple- mentary explanation for the Uprising was that everybody in India was completely enraged at having to learn to behave themselves under the wonders of British rule-- much the way we are told today that 9/11 happened because an unspecified\'they\'were\'jealous of our freedoms.\'(e.g., see how it seemed to the Metcalfe family ) William Dalrymple is the first British historian to use material in translation from numerous sources written in Persian and Urdu , and among the first to use the palace and city records now stored in the National Archives, As a writer of popular histories, he has a tough row to hoe in terms of publicizing his perceptions and findings, novel and dangerous to some and not radically different enough for others. Still signing away on his book tour , I suppose, he is more inclined to discuss the hard causes of the Uprising during interviews than in this book. With respect to softer causes, like Evangelism, which he positions centrally, he doesn\'t indulge in overkill to make a point, but sometimes confuses anger with fear and takes at face value what he could examine a bit more critically. Animal grease and surging Evangelism were no doubt the last straw, but only because the orders to use them could not have been perceived as a simple misunderstanding after a century of many kinds of deliberate and outrageous British assaults on Indian culture, property, laws and human rights. About this, a variety of Indian and foreign-born people had already reached consensus many times , sometimes long before 1857. Those harsher provocations are not discussed in The Last Mughal , which focuses on events in Delhi, which was at that time still a grand and antique city in a state of preservation , home to an exquisite culture. One hopes WD is saving the tougher subject matter of how to assign responsibility for the background of the cataclysmic events of 1857 for another book. As it is, he has already told The Hindu that this book has made him more friends in India than in England. KASHMIRI GATE IN 1880 The book is cause for celebration. The thinking is sensitive, the language is fluid and rich. It conveys the excitement of breaking new ground, and the pictures and line drawings at the start of each chapter are delightful. The two new maps parading as old ones, in which Metcalfe House seems to dwarf the Imperial Palace , Hindus seem to live east of the Ganges and 1857 looks like the 16th century, are very silly, but one can\'t let that get in the way. The British sources tend towards diaries and letters, and produce an up-close-and-personal effect, while the Persian and Urdu source material is more often drawn from professional writing of various kinds, so it generates a more public voice and panoramic view. Going back and forth between the two sides of the narrative, I felt as if I was walking up and down a seesaw, faster and faster, back and forth, until the final British-led bloodbath led onto the slow, grim comedy of the denouement. As a child, I always wondered about the the strange reek inside the Mughal tombs of Delhi, something like ancient bird droppings, which was missing at the Taj Mahal. I\'d been told that these crumbly, dark and elegant monuments belonged to the 16th and 17th KHOONI DARWAZA, WHERE THREE SENIOR PRINCES WERE STRIPPED, SHOT AND THEIR BODIES ROBBED OF JEWELRY by MAJOR WILLIAM HODSON centuries, and never thought about that again. Now, this book has brought home to me how recent was their ruin , how active the scent of death and decay that hangs about them still, that many of them were family mausoleums, and that my great-grandfathers had already been born before a long, gruesome seige and a grisly genocide was carried out in those environs in broad daylight. I remember the vultures were still all over Delhi more than a century later. WD\'s recent article in The Guardian explores similarities between British thinking in 1857 and widespread present perceptions in the West about the Iraq War. From some perspectives, the similarities are obvious and striking; from others, the similarities are not fully admissible. It is certainly alarming to find that the mainstream press has reactivated the very same language last used by the British in 1857 to describe the Uprising--- to describe THE IRAQ WAR TODAY . It is disheartening to see that in the post-colonial world, complications and spiraling violence can still be as easily provoked and fed upon by occupying forces playing on internecine rivalries. It is unpleasant to remember that the Bush Administration claimed to have received their intelligence about WMD from British sources . It is strange to see Queen Elizabeth, who last visited Washington to bestow an award on George Bush Sr. for planning and executing the first Gulf War, now returning to reinforce the military alliance . Meanwhile, Tony Blair, who should probably, given the current scheme of things, be tried by a kangaroo court and hung up to dry, is being sent off on an international farewell tour instead. One must wonder, are her private assets not yet suitably diversified? KASHMIRI GATE I appreciate and enjoy The Last Mughal for the depth and decency and richness of its narrative, and will read it many times, but I don\'t see the point of setting out a new and elaborate defense to counter the British allegations of 150 years ago. The British position, developed to justify deposing the monarch, was that Bahadur Shah Zafar was singularly responsible for fomenting a pan-Islamic rebellion against the British stretching from West Asia across India. Although Sa,\'am Husein might not have been plotting anything like that either, to draw any similarities by implication and suggestion is to stretch facts to fit the polemic. The question that goes unanswered is, did the British deserve it then, and have we and anyone else done anything to deserve it now? There is no question that the movements of 1857 included Muslim jihadis, as did others that came before in the multitude of violent eruptions that represented efforts to rid the Subcontinent of the British occupation. Surely the more important point is that these populist, pan-Indian movements brought about consensus across religious and cultural lines about British wrongdoing, and eventually gave birth to cooperative, sustained resistance, rather than belonging to or advocating for any religion. Today\'s popular resistances in West Asia carry forward a different set of historical grievances and cultural motifs, although they may one day coalesce and draw a motley set of movements together so that even Sunni and Shia will come to terms . WD either avoids or misses a key opportunity to emphasize the crossover nature of the Uprising: When the sipahis call Zafar\'Prithviraj,\'WD offers a literal translation, i.e., Ruler of the World. If this had been their intention, the sipahis might have called him Shah Jehan IV. Zafar was more Rajput than Timurid by blood, though he was also considered a Sufi pir, so the the sepahis were more likely referring to the heroic and legendary 12th Century Rajput emperor, Prithviraj Chauhan III , the last Hindu monarch to be seated at Delhi. But of course, at 82 years of age, though he might be the rightful emperor, Zafar could be no Prithviraj. WD suggests that if Zafar had led the charge to defend Delhi while the defense was on an upswing, he might have reversed the course of history. But at that point in the book, WD has already established that the aged cultural and spiritual leader was far too physically feeble to do anything of the kind. Except the occasional nut job, most European monarchs were by then pretty far distanced from being military leaders, and e

well many of you know the battle that is waged in the gotch household almost every day . . . jen vs. andrew in THE BATTLE OF SOUP (dah dah dah daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah). it has been a losing battle on my end for about 4 years running. you know how he has his list of foods he hates (wet meat, pulpy juice, cherries, pickles, and on and on)? well soup always seems to find it\'s way to the top of the list. this is a problem for me, since i am a soup lover. i love to eat soup, i love to make soup and when i feel that first bit of cold in the autumn air (which in l.a. means when it drops below 70 degrees), i want soup. and yesterday, for some o,\' reason, he agreed to a pot of soup. i think it is mostly because i told him it had peanut butter in it, and peanut butter is at the top of his\'foods i love\'list right after hamburgers. so after a short trip to the market, some chopping of vegetables, and warming of bread, soup was served. and it was good, real, real good. andrew ate every last drop, only quizzing me a few times about the ingredients. i was reluctant to tell him there was salsa in it, because he doesn\'t like cooked tomatoes or tomato soup. it didn\'t seem to phase him. he even ate the garbanzo beans, and he hates beans, except green beans. later that night, when the truth was rising to the surface, he confided in me that next time, he could do without the beans. i reminded him that he loves humus, but that was not enough.\'it\'s a texture thing, not a taste thing\'he calmly replied. either way, i feel like some progress was made here last night. there is even talk of more soup next week. i\'ll keep you posted. here\'s the recipe if you are interested.
I have some photos I\'ve been meaning to post from David Reid who went to Lola a few months ago. I\'ve post them all over the next few weeks!This is Makali, a bonobo rescued from a biomedical centre. He has somethign to say! Noki and her baby are in wonderful health! they\'ve been released into the enclosures. Noki is nursing her baby well and protecting her from slapping branches and the sun. but she is also very proud and loves to show the baby to the other bonobos! ooo - i got this photo from Val when Noki just arrived at Lola. Val is a volunteer at Lola - and has been for 15 years. She works practically full time handling Lola\'s accounts - the sanctuary wouldn\'t run without her. She comes in to Lola almost every day, for no recognition or reward other than helping the bonobos. We love you Val! and look at little Noki and those huge black eyes.and then here is Val helping Noki give birth - 10 years later!we share so much with these bonobos, they become so much a part of our lives. Val has been sending photos like crazy - she is a very proud grandmother. Ok back to Lola now and I\'m a little behind on all the news - but Noki had a baby!! Noki is one of the cat burglers at Lola - she is also a prolific tool user - which bonobos haven\'t been seen to do in the wild, fyi. once she used a long stick to steal my camera bag. noki is also one of the smartest bonobos in all the experiments we do - she is so wildly interested in all the tests and sometimes we have trouble getting her out of the testing room!  now she has a baby!! Fanny the vet was there for the whole thing, and so was Valerie, who was there when Noki was first rescued...
This week\'s tag was captured by John. Unlike some tags, there\'s little debate over what the tag is trying to convey - Peace for All! Lovely sentiments! Last week it really felt as if spring had arrived - even the sidewalks were shouting out that spring had sprung! Well, as anyone who has lived in this area for any amount of time knows, it is waaaaay too early to pack up those coats, hats and gloves. Fortunately, at least according to the AccuWeather forecast, after today, things will start improving again and the forecast is for fair skies and pleasant temperatures for the rest of the week. That\'s a good thing since Wednesday is St. Patrick\'s Day - although it\'s not an official holiday, in Lakewood it does appears to be a day when many people take the day off - perhaps as a\'mental health day.\'The light grows stronger in March, perhaps it is the light which inspires the caretaker to spring clean. The garden is being prepared - the tall dried grass has been cut, the ground is bare and awaits for the evolution of spring. A squirrel has come to help the gardener and finds a wayward acorn. To see all the snaps of the second Sunday statue series go here . Yesterday while I was wandering about I met little Jenny (mixed breed puppy) and her new family. It was Jenny\'s first day with her new family. In a,\'ition to coming into a loving human family, Jenny will benefit from being adopted into a family with a wise and older dog Jack (seen above). As I was leaving Jenny and her family, more neighbors came up to welcome Jenny into the hood - this time a big, friendly dog and two of his humans. Today\'s Skywatch Friday photos were taken in the Birdtown district of Lakewood. Birdtown is Lakewood\'s oldest neighborhood and is home to many beautiful churches, most of the churches were founded by various immigrant groups who settled in Lakewood to work in the factories which dominated the Birdtown District. The three churches pictured today are all located on Quail Street and include St. Gregory the Theologian and Northcoast Baptist Church (above) and St. Nicholas Ukrainian Orthodox Pro-Cathedral (right). To read more about the history of Birdtown check out this wonderful website which is sponsored by the city of Lakewood. Another excellent account of the history of Birdtown can be found on this website , sponsored by the Lakewood Historical Society. To see more photos of the sky around the world visit here! Today\'s theme for TT is HATS! In keeping with the S nap\'s established Theme Thursday tradition today\'s puzzler takes us to an emporium of delights. Who can name this classy store which sells pretty much anything one could possibly desire? I will provide a hint in the figure of E,\'ie, one of the store\'s owners, the store is not named after E,\'ie, but is named after his charming wife. E,\'ie strikes a pose in front of just a few of the store\'s many hats which are displayed above his own hatless head. As you begin to wander through the store you will encounter one treasure after another - who knows you may even encounter a hat or two in the most unexpected places! The store specializes in furniture, jewelry , pottery, and glassware. The store is opened six days a week - Monday through Saturday, 11 AM to 6:00 PM. This evening after all the Snap readers have a chance to play today\'s puzzler, I will come back to a,\' the name and location of today\'s site to today\'s post - and I hope the next time you are near it you will pop in and take a wander, I\'m sure you won\'t be disappointed, and if you are like me will be sure to find something that you just had to take home! A,\'endum: Anonymouse nailed the store right off! congratulations! This delightful shop which is owned and operated by E,\'ie and Connie Dean is called Connie\'s Classics . It is located in the Birdtown District of Lakewood at 12603 Madison Avenue. Stop in and tell them that you read about them on the Snap! Tuesday was an absolutely beautiful day! Here\'s a few snaps from my walk around town. I met a few Lakewood students who graced me with an impromptu concert! This young man strikes a pose and and diverts my eye from watching the tow truck. Word to the wise - don\'t forget to feed those parking meters and obey the parking rules. The Lakewood traffic enforcement patrol is serious! No parking worries when a skateboard is one\'s main means of transportation! What came into your head when you first saw this plate? The first thing that I thought of was\'one left to leave\'- possibly meaning the person driving this car has one kid was still at home. And, if this is the message, are we to assume that the driver of the car is looking forward to the day when all the kids are on their own or is this a statement of anticipatory grief? However, soon I thought of another possible message - what did you think of? Inquiring minds would love to know.

Whatcha got cookin\'? Al the Retired Army Guy is a reader of this here blog and a student at the New England Culinary Institute. Here\'s a quickie blog on of one of his latest projects. From Al: Here are a few pictures of a display platter my classmates and I worked on. If you\'re wondering why everything appears shiny, it is because all of the food is coated in aspic (gelatin) to give the food a shine for display purposes only. It isn\'t meant for consumption, though you could eat it if you wanted to. I wouldn\'t mainly due to the gelatin. Without the gelatin, though--> ;-) In the pictures you will find a terrine, a liver pate, and a duck galantine, as well as two vegetable garnishes. There is also a beet/pickled onion salad, with an orange vinaigrette (you can\'t really see the vinaigrette). The single plate represents a single serving of the components contained in the platter. It took us about six hours to put five coats of aspic on every individual piece. The vegetables were individually carved and placed as well. I did the \'pointy\' rutabaga bases you see, as well as the chioggia beets (the purple ones, carved into fleurons or a crescent shape). I did the orange/white squares you see inside the circular garnish on the right side of the platter. The terrine, galantine, and liver pate were made for us by classmates and our instructor. Overall it was a lot of fun. All the attention to detail I learned while in the Army definitely pays off while doing things like this. - - - Looks good, Al. Now whydontcha come over here and wrangle up something for dinner? - - - Thirteen years ago, I pulled a novel from a bin at the library\'s used book sale and paid one dollar for it. Sapphire\'s Push immediately engaged me and I didn\'t put it down until I\'d reached the last page. The book takes stylistic risks, with Precious Jones narrating her own story in a phonetically realistic voice. She is poorly dressed and obese, the sort of person many of us pass on the street and never see. Therein lies the brilliance of the novel. Push puts Claireece Precious Jones and her harrowing life squarely in front of the reader. If this was difficult and compelling to watch unfold on the page , the trailer for the movie Precious indicated it would be stunning on the screen as well. After much consideration, I decided to take my 12-year-old daughter to see Precious.\'I was really rooting for Precious,\'I said as we talked about the movie on the way home.\'Me too,\'said Jessie. I was bowled over by Gabourey Sidibe\'s portrayal of Precious. If possible, she realized Sapphire\'s vision with near perfection--as someone who is so easy to dismiss, until you really see her. Then she is impossible not to embrace. To be honest, I had some literary quibbles with the novel, but my respect for the risks it took overwhelmed them. The film has received raves as well as scathing criticism for being\'a strange combination of liberal guilt and condescension,\'which is a point well taken. I apologize that I cannot find the link now, but one of the reviews I read took issue with Precious\'s weight saying something to the effect of must she be so fat that her face is distorted? Then darling Howard Stern chimed in last week with his obnoxious comments about Sidibe. I was infuriated by this stupidity. Don\'t these morons realize that the driving force of Precious is a main character who is the antithesis of Gwyneth Paltrow and Reese Witherspoon? Her physical size is symbolic. It\'s one of the reasons she will not be denied. Whether you\'re on the pick or pan side of the reviews, that ambition deserves respect. As for Sidibe, I think you\'re beautiful, Gabourey. Now go bury the likes of Stern with a long and illustrious career. - - - I apologize in advance for this, but some things just have to be gotten through. See what I mean? Now for a random list of observations. 1. No small task keeping the cleft of venus off screen in that footage. Kudos to filmmaker Gary He. 2. Those crystals aren\'t going to be very jazzly after BooBoo and BamBam have a few rolls in the hay. 3. What if you lose some of those crystals? I mean really lose them?\'Um, SugarPop? The one wing of your butterfly is, like, gone.\'I think we all know just how embarrassing that\'s going to be. 4. I\'ve always liked Jennifer Love Hewitt. She\'s not A-list or B-list. She\'s your A-/B+ list and I can get behind that. Hence, you can imagine my reaction when she goes on George Lopez and announces she\'s had some spa-person glue beads around her zorch. Who does that? 5. Regarding this exciting new phenomenon, my bud Steven Gould had this to say,\'I\'m still a guy who prefers hair, uh, hairy, uh, you know. Vahaired.\'I think he\'s onto something with\'Vahaired.\'With all this new shit coming down the pike, we\'re going to need titles, categories--the whole drill. 6. I wonder if there are guys out there with beads stuck around their peckers. I wouldn\'t ever want to see any dickazzled or ballazzled anything. Nope, regular big hairy guys with beer for me. (Did you notice how I got right behind Steven on the New Age vocabulary job? I\'m cool like that.) 7. I bet Snooki is jazzled in places Jennifer Love Hewitt can\'t even imagine. 8. You\'ve probably noticed by now I\'m avoiding the word\'vajazzled.\'It makes me nervous. A word like that lands in your life and boy are you stuck with it. I don\'t like ultimatums, so I deal with this sort of thing in my own way. Hence this post. 9. I refer to my own pudendum as Glorious Steinem. - - -\'I can\'t think of anything that I liked in my twenties that I would want tattooed on my body now. Okay, maybe chicken Parmesan, but that would take up too much space.\'Now go read the rest of my good bu,\'y Paul Ita\'s latest essay for masslive: My Horrible Tattoo: A Cautionary Tale for America\'s Young People. - - - The above word cloud is courtesy of Wordle.

Come-hither bra display at the low grade closeout store.\'Honey, springtime is high time for a new toilet.\'- - - A post chock full of writing tips for all the young writers who contact me with questions about this crazy business and craft. Last updated 3/8/10. - - - Start local and small. My first paid bit of writing was for Ohio Writer . For my 900-word book review of Judith Hemschemeyer\'s The Harvest , I was paid the royal sum of $10. That was in June of 2000 (you can see how the next ten years unfolded for me here ). Building a professional writing portfolio and the associated career takes time, and it sprouts from humble beginnings. If I were starting out today, I\'d probably fish around for casual blogs associated with professional publications. Many daily and weekly print papers have online blogs that might not pay much, but would be an excellent place to earn a link and a bonafide publishing credential. Who knows? If an editor likes your style, it might lead to something more serious (and lucrative). Bonus tip: Leave a few comments on a blog (under your real name) that you might like to write for before querying the editor with your idea. Small local papers are often looking for writers to cover things like school board meetings and local government. These usually are paying gigs. I spent five years doing that sort of thing for The Broadview Journal . That stint earned me experience, street smarts, clips, a bit of local notoriety, and a steady paycheck. Get involved with a local literary or publishing organization. Here in Cleveland, we have The Lit, Cleveland Digital Publishing Users Group (CDPUG) , and the Cleveland Society of Professional Journalists. These types of organizations host all sorts of events, parties, and classes where you will meet professional writers and editors. If you want to be one of these people, you have to support what they do. That means buying their books, paying the club fees and having a genuine interest in their community. It means learning from them in an organic sense. This is perhaps the most important piece of advice I can offer a new writer. I\'m sure there are plenty of online sources as well. Many professional journalists I know are members of Freelance Success for example. Go to the library. There you will find droves of books dedicated to publishing and writing advice. Librarians are wonderful and can always make good suggestions. In my home library, I have a shelf full of Writer\'s Market editions. Two other good books to start with are The First Five Pages and The Elements of Style. Mind your manners in a cold contact. Don\'t ask established writers for big favors. Never send them unsolicited writing to critique. Also, don\'t ask a writer to do your work for you. Finding the right publications to query is hard work. The question,\'Where can I publish this?\'is almost never appropriate. Get online and start researching for yourself, or go find a copy of the LMP. Follow guidelines. When you\'re ready to submit, follow the guidelines on the agent\'s or publisher\'s site. If there are none, a one-page query is your best bet. NEVER use cutesy fonts or graphics or anything that discredits your professionalism. Get tough. The more successful a writer is, the more rejection they\'ve faced because they toughed it out and lived to submit another day. If you want to achieve success, you will get kicked. Hard. And repeatedly. When you get a rejection, send out another query the same day. It will help you keep your game face on. Sometimes you have to resort to Plan B and rethink your approach or your project, but giving up gets you no where. Your submission or query will likely get rejected again and again--until the one day when it gets accepted. Be warned: there is a growing trend in the publication industry wherein the powers that be simply do not respond to submissions that don\'t interest them. All you can do about\'passive\'rejections is keep a meticulous spreadsheet detailing all your queries with dates, names, pertinent websites, etc. Include any special notes as well. How long you wait to give up on getting a response is up to you, although sometimes an agency or publication will have response time info on their webpage. Simultaneous submissions? Again, your call. You are your own publicist. The days of the reclusive and mysterious writer sucking deeply from a Winston before his trusty Royal typewriter are gone. You must represent yourself and you must do it online. Prospective agents and publishers are busy people with no patience for ineptitude. If your information is more than a click away, you\'ll lose them. I recommend you maintain two types of webpage. This blog is my main active webpage. Content here is frequently updated. Here is my static/informational site. Content there does not change very often. If you are just starting out, your static page might simply include some education and contact information, and your active page may be a twitter account. However you choose to do it, you must have these things. Design, develop and shape them in a way that properly represents you and your work. They will evolve with you. They will surprise you as well. Bonus tip #1: Google Docs is a brilliant tool for creating static public webpages. Bonus tip #2: The way you drive a readership to your blog is by going to other sites that have the sort of readers you are trying to attract and leaving brilliant comments. And now for some miscellaneous links: They don\'t call it\'submission\'for nothing. Where I go to bellyache about writing. A whole podcast featuring Erin on Writing. Lastly, a bit of nostalgia. When I was a kid, I had a Mattel Knit Magic toy. You threaded the yarn through this squiggly little thing in the front, turned the crank, and PRESTO! a knitted tube would come out the bottom of the plastic machine. You were supposed to be able to do all sorts of things with the tubes, make groovy hats and stuffed dolls and scarves, but all I ever ended up with was a long tube, (although I did love my Knit Magic machine). When I lead discussions on writing, I often say that there is no Essay Magic machine, wherein you thread an idea in, turn a crank and watch an essay wind out from the bottom. The process I go through in order to produce a good solid piece of writing is laborious, wonderful, frustrating, difficult and satisfying. It has matured through the years. It is important to be in love with your process, to truly revel in the revelations, and savor the small victories. If you focus solely on that\'big\'publication, you risk missing the small and wonderful things that happen along the way. Write because you have something to say and your own way to say it. Write because you are driven to the craft. Above all, write because we need the good writers. We need their words and observations. We need them to scale and record the human condition. I will likely revise this page from time to time, so stop by again. And if you have good news, bad news, or your own advice to share, please do tell all in the comment section. Best of luck, Erin - - - My daughter had a tummy ache yesterday and we soothed it with many things, including a healthy dose of MTV\'s Liquid Television, which was one of my favorites shows of all time. We have about six hours of Liquid Television on VHS (taped in the 90s), so there was enough for this tummy ache and the next one as well. It worked perfect-as-you-please in the tape player that\'s still hooked up to our shitty 20\'CRT television. I swear, people, this is how you win. - - -

From the Romeo & Juliet photoshoot by Annie Leibovitz for the December 2008 issue of Vogue. &nbsp; I woke up to hear the news: Lee McQueen has died at age 40. He was found dead in his London home, having committed suicide due to depression which set in after his mother\'s death last week. My thoughts go out to his friends and family. On the Alexander McQueen website is this statement:\'On behalf of Lee McQueen\'s family, Alexander McQueen today announces the tragic news that Lee McQueen, the founder and designer of the Alexander McQueen brand, has been found dead at his home. At this stage it is inappropriate to comment on this tragic news beyond saying that we are devastated and are sharing a sense of shock and grief with Lee\'s family. Lee\'s family has asked for privacy in order to come to terms with this terrible news and we hope the media will respect this.\'While most of us fans and fashion lovers never knew him personally, we feel the loss keenly. McQueen was an exciting, inspiring designer and, through his clothes and runway shows, he made a connection with us. He will be missed for a long time to come. Wendy Brandes posted this video of a holographic Kate Moss floating in air like an angel, in an ethereal Alexander McQueen gown. I agree &#8212; one of the most beautiful things ever to grace a runway. There will be no more posts today, out of respect for a great designer, who left this world too soon.

Activists help put an end to gross negligence and primate deaths at a University lab . It\'s amazing to me that most Universities, even seemingly progressive ones like UC Berkeley, conduct useless experiments on animals. Legendary\'Humanzee\'Oliver, his friends, and the bitter fight over animal welfare at a Texas refuge .\'MEPs Jens Holm, Caroline Lucas, Sajjad Karim, and Robert Evans are today calling on other MEPs to back a landmark call to make plans for an end to the use of chimpanzees and monkeys in experiments across the European Union (EU) . The call comes at a point when almost 50 MEPs have signed a declaration before the European Parliament to end primate research across the EU in the next six years.\'Let\'s hope the U.S. wakes up and follows Europe\'s lead. I find it very sad that we as a nation aren\'t leading this fight for compassionate science. New Iberia Research Center (NIRC) has the most captive primates in the world, and is affiliated with the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. A former employee revealed disturbing allegations of animal cruelty that prompted an investigation and lawsuit , and another group that analyzed reports requested from the University (as is our right under the Freedom of Information Act) found disturbing signs of abuse and neglect relating to a group of rhesus monkeys . NIRC has also conducted maternal deprivation experiments , what I consider to be one of the more cruel, useless, abominable\'research\'activities. Write to Thomas J. Rowell, the veterinarian in charge, and request that the aging chimpanzees under his care be released to a sanctuary. These animals will not be forgotten. Thomas J. Rowell, DVM New Iberia Research Center University of Louisiana at Lafayette 4401 W. Admiral Doyle Drive New Iberia, LA 70560 Karen - age 48 Billy Ray - age 47 Clay - age 46 Diana - age 46 Jan - age 46 Julius - age 46 Lady Bird - age 46 Pumpkin - age 46 Sandy - age 46 Walter B. - age 46 For example, Primarily Primates, Inc. , which housed several retired research chimps, is apparently a pit of despair. Also, facilities that receive federal funding such as Chimp Haven must return animals to laboratories if they are requested to. In my book, that\'s not really retirement. Project R&R; has a list of sanctuaries that can take animals , and notes which have received funding, and I assume approval, from them. Personally, after watching Chimpanzees: An Unnatural History on PBS and getting to\'know\'Gloria Grow , I think the Fauna Sanctuary is truly a place that\'s earned it\'s name. Most Americans think that chimpanzees who have spent more than 10 years in research deserve to be retired : seventy-one percent of us, in fact. Despite this, nearly 90 percent of lab chimps have been used for more than 10 years. Jane Goodall\'s pioneering research has opened a window into the private lives of chimps. To read how similiar they are to humans, visit JGI\'s Chimpanzee Central .\'Once we admit that we are not the only beings with personality, reasoned thought, and above all, the ability to feel and express emotions such as joy, despair and empathy, then we develop a new respect for chimpanzees. The line between human and other non-human beings, once thought so sharp, becomes blurred. This forces us to a new respect also for the other amazing animal beings with whom we share the planet.\'From the Wisconsin State Journal :\'A Dane County judge said Monday that the law is on the side of animal-rights activists who want to buy buildings next to the UW-Madison\'s primate labs and open a museum highlighting the cruelty they say happens at the labs.
There was a stream of cars passing right before I took this picture. Each one paused as it approached the green light, thanks to the curb extension which pinched the intersection as well as making the walk crossing distance so much shorter. Such a nice treatment for this block, which is actually rather lengthy though residential, with parking on both sides. Cars used to speed up the hill to catch the green light - this pinch point helps to remind them to take it easy. In the world of transportation, this is really great stuff and part of the Downtown Brooklyn Traffic Calming study , which T.A. instigated ages ago, and is finally coming to fruition. There are more than 100 improvements slated for this spring according to the NYC ,\'C and above is an excellent example. An interesting thing about NYC\'s improvements on the street: though there is an attempt to standardize improvements with the Street Design Manual , there is also a wide variety of applicable treatments. These are the first white ADA-compliant curb cuts I\'ve seen in the city - I\'ve also seen yellow and gray. I kinda like that there is some flexibility and experimentation with this, and not one size (or color) fits all. After decades of one-size fits cars, seeing how things break loose is rather fun. Image by Youngna Park, available via the always wonderful 20x200 Exciting news! T.A. is starting up a Planning Corps, to gather together planners/designers and apply their amazing skills for change on our streets. This idea was hatched out of numerous conversations with two different groups that only sometimes interact. One set was with T.A. staff who wanted to beef up on technical expertise and stay relevant. The face of advocacy has changed considerably in the past few years, tools are very different, technology development outpaces a small non-profit organization\'s ability to keep up, and the political climate is very different. Generally, we\'re pretty nimble, but this is partly because we know when to change accordingly. The second set of conversations was with planners who had a itch to change the conventions of urban planning. How do we use planning in a way that benefits communities and organizations that really need it, instead of contributing to master plans that sit on the shelf or to EIS\'s that become a mockery of true environmental sustainability impacts? Not to say that long-term planning isn\'t necessary, but what can be done now to enable change? A call was put out for planners (e-mail me if you\'re in the NYC area and are interested in participating) and a project list from T.A. staff was compiled. But... As I was trying to come up with projects that people could work on, I realized that I was really grappling with conventions of planning and experiencing how deeply ingrained they really are. The staff came up with a long list of projects necessary for their campaigns. Most of them are those that are one-on-one with a staffer or small group (aka the\'client\'), longer-term due to research, data collection, where the planner goes off to do work, whatever that is, and hopefully comes back with a final product. But the ones that the planning group expressed interest in are those that can be done in a group, at once and still end up with something useful. (Charrettes qualify, but few other things do - can you think of any?) I was really challenged with coming up with\'on the spot\'project ideas where a group planners could come in and get their hands dirty right away. At minimum, planning projects must have a strong connection to T.A. advocacy - so that there is a high potential for change. That part wasn\'t hard. What was hard was thinking about re-structuring work so that it had at-the-moment application and was highly productive. I stopped worrying about how it would happen and embraced the idea that what we needed could be done in many different ways. But, that means that the hard work is really on us, the organizers of Planning Corps, to structure creatively any piece of work on the existing project list so that it can be done in a group, at once and productively. If we get through this though then maybe we\'ll start to see a shift in how planning can change. Planning Corps is new with lots of space for experimentation, so if you have ideas and suggestions, please do share. Our first meeting will be March 24, location TBD. People\'s schedules change quite a bit as job/personal responsibilities shift, so the hope is that the way Planning Corps works - matching planners to non-profits/campaigns for change - will endure. It\'s all over the transportation world, but worth posting about here. NYC is getting closer and closer to delivering transitways - first Select Bus Service , especially the designs for 1st and 2nd Aves, now this proposed project on 34th Street . Thanks DOT for trying out another innovative design in CBD Manhattan. This is a huge improvement in terms of prioritizing use on our streets. What do vehicles really need to move? This is a much more efficient use of the public right-of-way, let alone a vast improvement over streets clogged with one-passenger cars. You can leave comments on the project page and there\'s a series of public input workshops going on this spring. (I would be curious about handling bicycle traffic, curbside management of drop-offs and deliveries, and timing of projects in other boroughs). via Streetsblog , which you should visit for a detailed discussion and some interesting comments Always love to see who wins the Young Architects Program competition to design the front yard of P.S. 1 . Pole Dance by SO-IL doesn\'t look as salacious as it sounds. d, you\'re coming back to NYC for the opening, right? Go for it! Update: not public space related, nor really planning related, I realized belatedly. Did I really fall for the sparkling logo? Maybe. From GOOD the OBJECTIVE Make an infographic about neighborhoods and/or your neighborhood. the Assignment Missed the MAK Center\'s how many billboards in LA. Update: Was wondering how I missed the billboards when I crossed paths with the art so many times...in the car that is. I\'m rarely in a car in general. Guess I never looked up in LA. I\'m fascinated by driving behavior in general. Everyone trying to talk to each other while muted; imagine trying to tell someone where you are going while covering your mouth. Little signals mean a lot. I also obsess over pedestrian behavior: are they walking for fitness, fun or work, with friends, where are they walking to/from, do they cross with the light? Enthralled by the few mixed-use retail areas. It seemed like LA lacks bus shelters though there are many bus riders. Finally, I literally count cyclists, check out their bike and see if they obey traffic laws. Total urban planning-transpo-geek. Real guerrilla gardening from the artist Pete Dungey .
Julia has a friend who started keeping bees four or five years ago. The friend had four hives. Almost as soon as she started on this hobby, a crisis occurred - her house burned in a really bad fire. So the bees have lived in her backyard for four years with nobody taking care of them. The friend invited Julia (my partner at Blue Heron) to come and salvage these hives. Julia in turn invited me, dangling the possibility that if there were live bees we might each get a hive out of it. We decided that if we did get hives, we would probably put them at Blue Heron or at the new Little Nancy Creek Park where I have asked that we be the beekeepers.The first hive was dead and empty of everything. All of the wax had been eaten out by wax moths. New wax had been built in the hives but it was abandoned. There were wax moth cocoons under the inner cover and the hive was dead. Probably the original bees had died and a swarm moved in (making the new wax) and then either absconded or died as well.
1887 \'Mind you stay together, you lot! Make sure you\'re back before it gets dark and don\'t go far! You hear?\' \'Yes, Mam,\' echoed the trio of children hu,\'led around the door of the small terraced house before setting off down the street and making their way to the lane leading up to Sky Pond, their tongues wagging and jam jars clanging when their clogs made contact with the cobblestones. Half way up the lane, the mood changed as the rules for the afternoon were laid down. \'We don\'t want any whinging from you, our Gracie!\' the tallest boy snapped, pointing a bony finger into the chest of the frail-looking girl in front of him. His other arm lay limply by his side. \'If me and our Bunny find a docker and want to share it, we will. If you go telling our mam, we\'ll have yer guts fer garters!\' \'I know better than to tell me mam, Alan,\' Gracie snapped back at him. \'I\'ve still got the bruises from last time!\' \'Right then. Don\'t say I haven\'t warned yer.\' \'Don\'t think Gracie should be going up Hades on her own. It might rain,\' the younger boy quipped hesitantly. \'It might rain? It might bloody rain? Listen, soft lad, it might rain every blinking day! Like our dad says, if it ain\'t raining it\'s just about to!\' The face of the younger brother flashed as red as his hair and Gracie came to his aid. \'Don\'t worry about me, Bunny. I\'ll be fine. I only want to go up t\'stones and dance with the fairies fer a few minutes. I\'ll be straight back down,\' she bent down to his level and gave him a reassuring smile. Bunny gave her a reluctant one in return. \'Yer can come with me, if yer want?\' Gracie a,\'ed, wide-eyed. \'He not going chasing fairies, \' proclaimed Alan sarcastically. \'He\'ll turn into one -  he\'s already half way there! He\'s coming with me -  I need him ter help me catch the ta,\'ies.\' Bunny\'s face crumpled when he heard Alan\'s words. He wiped his nose across the sleeve of his threadbare jumper several times and then hitched up his short patched trousers. \'Right, make yersel\' scarce, Gracie,\' ordered Alan, walking on and dragging Bunny by his clean sleeve. \'Up ter top, five minutes and straight back down to meet us by t\'pond.\' \'Righty ho,\' said Gracie, breaking away from them and giving Bunny a wave. \'An\' don\'t be late!\' shouted Alan. \'Or I\'ll...\' \'Have me guts fer garters!\' shouted Gracie, pulling a funny face that only Bunny caught sight of. She started running, laughing with excitement as she did so and occasionally turned around to watch the minute figures of Alan and Bunny trotting off in the opposite direction towards the deep black sparkle of Sky Pond. Part way up, Gracie lost sight of her brothers and sat down on the gorse and heather-clad hillside and surveyed the mill town at its foot. The crowd of smoking giant chimneys of the cotton mills below reminded her of the dragon that St. George must have fought in the pace egg play. She shu,\'ered. It was no secret how hard it was in those mills. Her older sister Katie had aged years since she\'d started work there. And now that Gracie was ten, she only had a couple of months to go before she would join her, as Alan\'s gammy arm had prevented him from taking his turn first. She wished she could be like Miss Annabella Templeton and go to school until she was grown up, or be a doll like Lady Caroline Theawicke! Mind you, she didn\'t want the curse that Lady Caroline had to live with, no way! She would rather be friends with fairies than devils! Perhaps Ma Crabtree was right when she\'d read her mam\'s tea leaves last week. \'There will be no mill for Gracie!\' Maybe she would be lucky and fall for a job as a servant instead? A dark cloud passed overhead and Gracie looked up. Bunny was right, it looked like rain. She smiled when she noticed the full moon in the afternoon light -  there would be fairies today -  definitely! She ran on gaily. --- Panic swept the whole street. Men stood on the corners talking earnestly, women sobbed silently so as to not scare the children. They were all scared though. Every last one of them. Young Grace Regan had gone missing up on Hades Hill and her brothers claimed she was away with the fairies! Ma Crabtree believed them, as did many of the older members of the community, such as Fanny Parkinson who had gone through the tor ring backwards when she had failed to conceive after eight years of marriage. Ma had told her what to do and her belly had been full within the year. Fanny\'s child had the ability to see things others couldn\'t, too, just like Ma. Ma waited for the knock at the door -  she knew they would come. When the hilltop had been searched and no body had been discovered, they would seek her out and she would tell them what they already knew but didn\'t want to believe -  not yet. After a while, she knew they would want to believe it for anything would be better than thinking the child was dead. Mind you, she had seen it in the cups and had told the mother that there would be no mill for Gracie! The mother had taken it that another occupation would call instead, but Ma had a good idea at the time that it had something to do with the stones. She hadn\'t expected them to take the child away though, it had been a long time since that had happened. Since before her time. The knock came, just as she knew it would. She put the kettle on and answered the door. They already knew where Gracie had gone, but they had to hear it from someone else, someone who knew about these things. Next Prev 1967 Elizabeth ran down Market Street and turned into Cotton Row. She needed to be quick -  super quick. Her mother knew exactly how long it should take her to do the errand. Even if there was a queue in the Co-op it should not take more than twenty minutes, any longer and she would be straight after her. She looked up at the grey stone building. All the previous times she had passed it she had never paid it much attention. Funny that, because the building looked just like something out of a fairytale. It was so easy to imagine Rapunzel sitting at the turreted window. From where Elizabeth stood, she could clearly see two entrances. She much preferred the grand entrance with the door that looked as though it belonged to a castle, but her gran,\'ad had specifically said that she should go in the side one. Elizabeth was fascinated by the stained glass in the window of the side entrance door. She could make out angels, flowers and animals. She wished she had the time to look at it in more detail but she didn\'t have a second to spare. Breathless she rushed inside. Elizabeth stared hard. The man standing before her looked like a real live angel! He even sounded like tiny chimes; she was positive that the vague tinkling she could hear was coming from him. She studied him closely. His long blond hair fell loosely to his shoulders, like Prince Charming in her storybooks at home. This must be the \'Tash fellow\' her gran,\'ad had told her she might see. She continued to stare wide eyed and panic started to rise in her. There was no way she was going to get the words out in time, make it to the shop, and make it back home again. There was no way! \'Don\'t be frightene,\'d Tashriel said, walking towards her. I don\'t bite. He smiled and Elizabeth continued to stare. She felt him touch her on the shoulder. \'Is that better?\' \'Yes, thank you,\' she heard herself say, gasping for breath. \'I\'ll have to be quick, I\'ve only got ten minutes to tell you and I have got to get to the shop and back home. I think I\'ve used nine minutes already! My mum will go mad if I\'m late back and...,\' she stopped for breath as he raised his hand. \'No need to worry, Elizabeth, there is plenty of time. I promise you that you will be home with minutes to spare.\' Elizabeth blinked several times and continued staring. He really was very pretty. \'So, now that we know why you are here, and...\' \'But I haven\'t told you yet!\' Elizabeth interrupted. \'I\'ve got a message for you from me gran,\'ad and...\' \'Yes I know,\' Tashriel replied softly. \'I knew what your message was as soon as you came in and I asked a friend of mine to go and fetch your gran,\'ad and meet us both here. We\'ve been searching for your gran,\'ad for a long time and now he has found us again. He\'s waiting for us with my friend Stanley in another room. Come with me.\' He held his hand out to her and Elizabeth placed her small one within it. \'Let\'s go and join them and have some tea.\' --- Lady Mabel Theawicke watched as the child and Tashriel left the red reception room at RoYds. \'It will be for the best if you stay away from Elizabeth from now on,\' she remarked, looking sternly at the man sitting in front of the fireplace with Stanley. Billy no,\'ed. He could still feel the weight of the child on his lap where she had been sitting earlier. It was almost like she had left a little imprint on his presence. He sighed. He liked the kid, she had done him a big favour, but he didn\'t need her any more. Besides, he had to go back before midnight. That was the bargain with Annwn and he had no choice but to stick with it. \'So, you have no idea what happened to your body, only that it\'s somewhere in the dell?\' Stanley asked, passing Billy a cigarette and lighting it for him. Billy inhaled deeply. By heck that\'s grand \'Should imagine so,\' replied Billy offhandedly looking off into space and then back at Stanley. \'I\'m not mithered, you know. It makes no difference to me. Unless some fucking hopper\'s running about in it! I shouldn\'t imagine it though? You would have heard about that by now if they was, wouldn\'t you?\' Stanley no,\'ed. \'Well then, best it stays where it is. It\'s obviously well hi,\'en. I\'ve no need for it either. I suspect after all these years the earth has already reclaimed it. Best thing all round if you ask me.\' \'So,\' Stanley said, sitting forward in his seat. \'This Gorgeous George bloke knocked you on the side of the head with some kind of object and that was it? No light, eh? And the next thing you know you are wandering around the dell twenty years later?\' \'That\'s about it,\' Billy answered, taking a final drag on his cigarette and throwing it into the fire. \'He died in an accident if I remember correctly,\' Lady Mabel looked across to Stanley for confirmation. \'Yes, he did. Car crash I think... Obviously, we took a great deal of interest in that outfit after your disappearance, Billy. We knew something had happened to you and that the answers lay with the Living. Never able to get to the bottom of it, mind you. The conclusion was that you had gone directly into the light.\' \'Aye, well who knows! Probably would have done, given half the chance! Anything would have been a damned site better than that place I ended up in!\' Billy shivered and gazed blankly at his knees. Stanley reached out and patted his shoulder. \'I remember he married Cora Woods and they had quite a handful of children. They seemed to be a good match as far as I coul,\'d announced Lady Mabel as much to herself as anyone else. \'Well, thankfully all that\'s over now and a new dawn has begun.\' quipped Stanley cheerfully. Billy looked up and directed his question at Lady Mabel. \'Elizabeth told me that...my...Anne died in 1952?\' \'Yes, that\'s correct,\' replied the Lady Mabel, walking over to him, her long grey skirts rustling. \'Did she...did she ever marry again?\' The mask of Lady Mabel\'s normally emotionless face cracked a little and her cornflower blue eyes held those of Billy\'s firmly. \'No. Anne never loved any man but you, Billy.\' Billy wiped away bu,\'ing tear drops from his own eyes with the back of his hand. \'Aye. I loved her and all that,\' he sobbed and then faded away. Next Prev 1967 Billy watched idly as the little old woman continued to laboriously bend and pick up the few dry birch twigs that were scattered around the clearing. Each stoop seemed to require twice as much effort than the last. So far, her daily foraging did not look to have been very successful. He looked up to the sky; the morning was quickly drawing in, he doubted that she would have the quantity of firewood she required to see her comfortably through the next day. Billy looked towards his own pile. It had taken a strapping bloke like him half the night to come up with a bounty like that. She had no chance! Billy watched as she struggled to tie her small bundle together. Her hands were chapped, the fingers knotted with age. He tensed as the bushes around him rustled and a little white terrier with one red ear emerged from the undergrowth and pa,\'ed up to him. He bent down to pat it and delighted with the dog\'s enthusiastic response, continued to make a fuss of it. \'Calm down now, la,\'d he said playfully, and stood up fully again. The dog reminded him of his own dog, Monty. He hadn\'t seen Monty since...he couldn\'t remember when. He looked over to where the old woman had been scavenging. She had moved on a bit, although her bundle of twigs had not grown any larger. Billy had seen the old woman on many occasions but he had never seen the dog before. \'Best get gone now,\' he ordered the dog. The dog splayed out on his belly and wagged his tail. Billy smiled despite himself. \'What\'s up with you? Eh...soft la,\'d he said, unable to resist bending down and making another fuss of it. The old woman had turned around and was catching up the distance between them. Billy noticed a dejected air about her and sighed. Grabbing a large amount of his own prized firewood, he ran over to her, the dog following behind. \'Here,\' he said, cheerfully thrusting the wood in the old woman\'s direction. \'Yer may as well ëave this lot as well!\' --- \'See that tree?\' Elizabeth looked over to where her mother was pointing and squinting through the sunshine, and peered closely at the very boring tree situated in the tiny garden beyond the graveyard they were standing in. Elizabeth no,\'ed. My dad planted that tree when I was not much bigger than you are now. In fact, I might have been even younger. He took the pip from an apple I had eaten and planted it in the garden. \'ëOne day,\' he\'d said, ëThere\'ll be a tree here even bigger than the house.\' And we both laughed. Every time I see that tree I think of my dad. Some people believe that as long as a person is remembered, they never die.\' Margaret smiled down at Elizabeth and ruffled her hair. Elizabeth looked at the colourful flowers carefully arranged in the vase beside the black marble headstone and the names carved upon it. 1952, that was in the olden days! Her mother must have been very young when her mum had died. Elizabeth felt sad thinking about it. \'We\'ll call in there and have a nice cup of tea with Mrs Bibby, shall we? See how she is?\' Margaret said encouragingly to Elizabeth. \'If you\'re a good girl, we can call and have a toasted teacake for tea at the Myna Bird Cafe!\' Elizabeth smiled brightly and skipped along the cobbled rake leading down from the graveyard and into the town square. --- Elizabeth concentrated on not staring at the grey whiskers on Mrs Bibby\'s chin. It would be such a disaster if she missed out on a visit to see the Myna bird. \'Why don\'t you go and play outside, dearie? It\'s such a lovely day and plenty of juicy apples have fallen off that tree today. Have a look and see if any of them are worth taking home with you!\' \'Yes, Mrs Bibby,\' she said in her best voice and skipped out of the tiny kitchen into the garden beyond. Most of the apples had tiny worms in them. Elizabeth giggled to herself; the worms always looked so funny wriggling about. Her dad always told her it was because apples were used to make cider and the worms were drunk. The warmer the day, the drunker the worms! These ones were steaming. Nobody likes me Everybody hates me \'I think I\'ll go and eat worms!\' Elizabeth sang out. Big fat juicy ones Eensie weensy squeensy ones \'See how they wiggle and squirm!\' Elizabeth giggled. \'What\'s your name?\' \'I\'m not supposed to talk to strangers!\' Elizabeth pouted at the man sitting on the grass beside her. \'I\'m not really a stranger.\' Elizabeth tilted her head to one side. \'Well, in that case, if you\'re not a stranger, you tell me my name!\' she said cheekily. The man laughed. \'You got me there! Is that your mum in there? I think that\'s your mum in there because that\'s my girl -  that\'s my little girl...Maggie.\' He answered looking through the kitchen widow and gazing into the room beyond. \'Not so!\' Elizabeth said standing up and putting her hands on her hips. \'That\'s my mummy and her name\'s Margaret, NOT Maggie!\' She stuck her tongue out at him and then screwed up her face. \'So there!\' The stranger also got up onto his feet. \'Margaret is her Sunday name but she was always my Maggie. See this tree here?\' Elizabeth no,\'ed wide eyed. \'Well, I planted this tree when it were a little tiny seed like this one here,\' he said, picking up another apple and plucking the seed from it. \'If you want, we can plant this seed over here and when you grow up it will be bigger than this house!\' He walked over to the far corner of the garden and waited for her to join him. \'My name is Elizabeth,\' she announced gaily. \'What\'s yours?\' \'Billy. You can call me gran,\'ad if you want.\' Elizabeth smiled and no,\'ed. \'Elizabeth\'s a Sunday name. How about I call you our Bess? \' Next Prev Refuge of Delayed Souls Ebooks are Free during Read an Ebook Week which runs from 7 - 10 March 2010 Use Coupon Code RFREE at the checkout.

Heard say now the war is over there\'s other places more suited to what they need. Heard they didn\'t much like it anyways, spooked by the dell. Its inhabitants more like -- after all those scare-stories we\'ve been spreading round!\' Raucous laughter spread throughout the pub like wildfire. Billy looked at his cards. He could win this round. Switch, the twenty stone King of Crime, was in a good mood for a change. Billy put out his cigarette and took a sip of his pint. \'It\'ll work out well for storage and also be a good place to hang out when the heat\'s on. That swine Allen\'s still got a face like a bulldog licking piss off a nettle despite all the readies we\'re bunging him. Heard he has quite a grudge against you, Billy -  been shagging his wife or summat?\' Blade asked, throwing a ten shilling note into the pot of coins and notes already on the table. The infectious laughter echoed around the room and Billy joined in. He didn\'t mind being the brunt of it, not tonight anyway. Not when he was on a winning streak. He placed his aces on the table. \'Not yet!\' he said coolly and lit a fresh cigarette. Switch studied him keenly and then burst out laughing. \'Not yet! Not bloody yet! I like his style!\' He pushed the money in the pot over to Billy and then continued in a more serious tone, \'What\'s he got against you, Billy? Apart from the fact that you are a lying, cheating little shit.\' Switch leaned in and held Billy\'s gaze a fraction longer than necessary. \'But then again -  aren\'t we all?\' he quipped, leaning back and pulling his braces forward. The room exploded once more. Billy casually collected his winnings off the table and put them in his inside jacket pocket. He made a mental note to give Ann a bob or two of it to spend on herself and the ki,\'ies. That was if he had any left after he had finished paying his dues and put aside what he needed for his fags, beers and bets next week. He drained his glass and passed it to the vivacious Cora who, as usual, was hovering enticingly nearby. \'A few year back I gave his mother one,\' replied Billy in a deadpan manner, inhaling deeply on his cigarette and blowing a smoke circle into the room. Switch actually looked like he believed him. \'I\'ve no idea,\' he a,\'ed quickly with half a smile. \'He\'s just a nasty piece of work.\' \'You can say that again,\' said Gorgeous George from where he stood, leaning against the bar leering at Cora as she walked past with her hands full of dirty glasses. Billy ogled Cora too. Been there \'Right, gentleman! Time to say good night and thanks for donating to the House of Lawrence. Same time, same place, tomorrow.\' Billy kicked his chair back and stood up. \'Not tomorrow,\' Switch looked up at him. \'I want you to deliver that last load down to the Nayes. Have it there for 10:00 p.m. Mark my words now, lad.\' Billy no,\'ed and walked away, stopping briefly on his way out to have a quiet word and squeeze with Cora at the bar. The opportunity to mark his territory was too tempting for Billy to resist. --- The road leading down to Staibey Nayes was accessed from the far side of town. It was tree lined, had no street lights and was wide enough for only a single vehicle to manoeuvre at any one time. The road continued for about three-quarters of a mile and to a stranger would seem to come to an end in a wood which appeared on the horizon beyond. A local, however, knew that just before the end of the road was reached, it branched off to the right and opened onto a building complex. During the war, the entrance to the complex had been barred by a gated sentry box which had been manned by two fully armed security guards at any one time. Tonight, though, the gate was open and the chain and padlock were tossed to the side of the road. The buildings had existed centuries before the war. For a period of time before war broke out, they had served as a depot for the engines which carried the stone through the dell from the quarries above. Prior to that, they were warehouses for the cloth made in the cotton mills close by and before that still, a local wool merchant had built his mansion here. Ever since records began, there had been buildings in the location of Staibey Nayes. Billy had learned that at school when they had been taught about the Doomsday Book. Billy expected to get a good cut from tonight\'s load. He had no compunction about fuelling the black market. After all, they were only supplying a demand and someone had to do it. If it wasn\'t them it would be someone else. Billy had expected to see other vehicles in the empty quadrant. He pulled up and parked the stolen lorry, and then checked his watch: 21:55. There was still time for a cigarette. He opened the cab door of the lorry and stepped outside into the cold night air. After transferring his cigarettes and matches into his trouser pocket, he threw his jacket and scarf back inside the cab despite the chill. The wind blew up and whistled through the trees, carrying the sweet scent of night blossoms and the call of an owl. Billy tried to decipher which part of the dell the sound had come from. The silhouette of the leafless trees against the raw black and twinkling night sky caught his attention and he leaned his head back and tried to decipher his favourite constellation, the Plough. The moment was spoilt when the door of the building to his right was opened and Gorgeous George waved him over. Both men worked up a sweat carrying the cargo from the lorry into the building where Gorgeous had been waiting. Billy also worked up quite a temper. He was raging that no one else had been there to help them. He wasn\'t anyone\'s fucking monkey! Switch should know better than to waste his time and sweat on shifting this crap. Eventually, the job was done and Billy followed Gorgeous back into the building to collect his earnings for the night\'s hard work. He couldn\'t wait to get his hands on that wad of cash! Gorgeous walked through the former office where they had stacked the goods and into the one beyond, where Billy could see a black holdall resting on a makeshift desk. Billy lit himself a well-deserved cigarette and as he waited for Gorgeous to get the money together, he walked over to the window to continue his earlier aborted search for the Plough. Fuck He threw his cigarette on the floor and stomped it out viciously. Standing against a dry stone wall near to the parked lorry below was a young woman in a red coat, looking up at him. Shocked, he watched dumbfounded as she turned and seemed to be intent on something that was happening in the dell beyond. Billy turned to let Gorgeous know about their unexpected visitor and felt the impact of a heavy metal object. Billy fell to the ground and into a vicious kick from the boot of Gorgeous George. \'Not so fucking handsome now, are you, Billy Boy?\' --- Billy was in the water, Charlie was crying out in the distance. Billy swam out to meet him. again and again Peg stood between Billy and Michael, her eyes wide and pleading. Billy lifted his rifle and pulled the trigger. again and again Cora moaned softly into Billy\'s ear, her breasts pressed tightly against his chest. Anne walked in and caught them. again and again Billy treaded water as the incendiaries came down and screams echoed around him. You\'re going to Hell, Lawrence \'I\'m already fucking there!\' He screamed. Next Prev 2008 \'Linus Howell,\' announced Stanley perplexed. \'I would recognise him anywhere,\' said Elizabeth with an involuntary shu,\'er. It was the first time they had all been together in one place for as long as Elizabeth could remember. Stanley had gathered together his war cabinet. The group of them were crowded around a large circular table in the red reception room at RoYds. Wilfred was busying stacking coals on the already roaring fire behind them. \'Kelly Crabtree is sitting in a classroom up at the college and all of his other victims are walking around as large as... life, \' a,\'ed Paul. \'It\'s as if his crimes never happened! Of course we know differently, but somehow Howell, or someone... something else, has managed to bewitch the Living into believing otherwise.\' Elizabeth noted the concerned looks around the room before shifting her attention towards Gemma who had placed herself in between Tashriel and Grispheran. Much to Elizabeth\'s annoyance, the latter was sitting sideways against the table his own attention also focussed firmly upon Gemma who was flirting with him outlandishly. \'Then there is only one explanation I can offer,\' said Stanley, lighting a cigar. \'Whatever Ed Lord uncovered up at Heyleigh Stones has magical properties. It would appear that we need to recover it and return it to where it belongs without further delay. \'Agree,\'d said Tashriel almost as if he was speaking for all of them. Lady Mabel leaned forward, placed her elbows on the table and the palms of her hands together as if in prayer. When she had everyone\'s attention, including Gemma and Grispheran\'s, she spoke with authority. \'The last time something like this happened...\' \'Was in 1946 when we first lost poor Mr Lawrence,\' interrupted Wilfred standing up from the fireplace and walking towards them. \'Ah, Wilfre,\'d said Stanley twisting in his chair and looking over his shoulder to get a view of him. \'Would you like to join us?\' he no,\'ed towards the empty chair beside Paul. The coal dust disappeared from Wilfred\'s hands as he joined them at the table and produced a delicious looking display of cakes upon a silver platter. \'Mr Lawrence?\' asked Elizabeth quizzically. \' Billy Lawrence?\' \'The very one, Miss,\' confirmed Wilfred. \'I did have a soft spot for Mr Lawrence, Miss. Dare say he reminded me of myself in some ways...\' \'Quite,\' said Stanley in an attempt to bring them back on track again. \'We can\'t talk about that little episode now -  we haven\'t got time. By the way, has anyone actually noticed the time by any chance?\' All eyes focussed on the Edwardian clock ticking merrily upon the black marble mantelpiece. \'What about it?\' asked Gemma. \'The clock looks to be working fine to me.\' \'Always does, Miss,\' replied Wilfred reassuringly. \'Then what are we looking at?\' questioned Paul. \'11 a.m.,\' announced Archie solemnly. \'And totally dark outside!\' Next Prev 1946 The safe job had been easy enough. Billy was aware that the police suspected he had been involved somehow. He also knew that if they could, they would fit him up for just about anything. The newly promoted Sergeant Allen in particular was a nasty piece of work. Takes one to know one Switch had been fair with Billy up until now, so he had no complaints. He had initially misjudged Gorgeous George and Dan the Man -  they were a bit barmy, mean to be sure, but not bad with it. You knew where you were with them and the consequences of crossing them, he could handle that. So far, there had been the one explosives job, a few lorry heists and a huge amount of black market profiteering. His little side job with RoYds was proving to be a good number too -  money for old rope. He wondered what they had in store for him this time as he walked up to the now familiar open oak door and stepped inside. \'Afternoon, Mr Lawrence. Dark out isn\'t it?\' Wilfred never changed. Billy wished he would take the stick out from up his arse and cut the brownnosing. \'Stanley in?\' he asked, throwing Wilfred his coat and starting off down the passageway. \'As a matter of fact, Sir, Lady Mabel would like a word with you this morning. You will find her in the office, Sir, first door on the left.\' Lady Mabel! He had yet to have the pleasure! He whistled merrily to himself as he continued down the opulent cobalt blue-decorated corridor and waltzed into the more practical office, usually reserved for unsuspecting members of the Living who required the services of RoYds. --- \'You want me to what?\' Billy snarled, closing the distance between them. \'Where the hell do you get the idea that I would do something like that? What do you think I am -  your lap-dog?\' He was furious. Jumped up little tart Billy stopped thinking when his back slapped against the wall behind him and his head smashed up against the ceiling. A split second later the door slammed furiously open and shut leaving him alone in the room. He looked down, the view was just like he suspected it would be from this angle -  not that he had ever given it much thought, mind you. He would probably break a bone or two if he just fell to the floor and said a silent prayer that whatever power was keeping him up would let him down slowly. Tashriel appeared in the room below and Billy found himself standing by his side. \'Silver.\' \'What?\' Asked Billy exasperatedly, brushing the plaster from his made-to-measure navy suit and exercising his neck in an attempt to ease the newly acquired crick in it. \'Silver. Offers no protection against your own kind, but if you carry some on your person, Lady Mabel -- and other factions -- will not be able to harm you. I doubt Lady Mabel intended you any real harm. You are still breathing.\' Smarmy pretty boy \'And who would you be then?\' Billy replied sarcastically. \'Someone she just mistook me for?\' \'I could always put you back up there if you prefer,\' Tashriel volunteered, looking up at the space Billy had so recently occupied. Calmer now, Billy considered Tashriel\'s offer. \'Er...no thanks!\' He pulled a packet of cigarettes from his inside pocket and helped himself to one before offering the packet to Tashriel. \'I know that Stanley enjoys a fag,\' he said hesitatively. Tashriel politely declined. \'What was it about Lady Mabel\'s request that enraged you?\' \'I\'m no cold blooded murderer!\' snapped Billy in reply, removing the lit cigarette from his mouth. \'Seems to me that witch is quite capable of doing the deed herself!\' Tashriel sighed, \'As I said, keep something silver on you at all times to prevent it happening in future. Better still, try to get control of your temper.\' Something about Tashriel\'s tone brought Billy to his senses. \'Aye. Suppose you\'re right.\' \'Besides, you are simply being asked to contain a situation,\' Tashriel remarked casually. \'The real John Sweeney is already dead -  your role is merely to evict the entity that is squatting in his body. --- It had been drizzling all day, perhaps all week, he couldn\'t remember. Billy wondered if it would ever stop and, upon further consideration, whether it was possible for an entire town to weep. Personally, he had no time for tears. As far as he was concerned, they would not serve any purpose and only distract from the job at hand. He buttoned up his navy overcoat, pulling the collar up as far as possible as he did so. Casting his eyes down towards the grey flagstone pavement, he took the identity of a grey man amongst other grey people. The house was straight ahead. It was not his first visit here; he had recce\'d the place on several occasions at various times of the day and night. He knew exactly where he was heading -  some would say straight to Hell. He had no doubt that he would be on the guest list if such a place existed. Nearly there now, he unbuttoned his overcoat, turned off his wandering thoughts and went into autopilot mode. He knocked on the door and it was answered almost immediately.
What?!?! MORE cupcakes? Where are the drawings and sewings and art, Alicia?\' you say.\'Psshaw!\' say I. \' I HAD to make them! They\'re brain slugs. I have no choice.\'And so this past weekend, I made some Futurama brain slug cupcakes for a birthday celebration. We needed something that could travel to the pub, be delicious, be to the birthday boy\'s liking in terms of content, and fairly quick and easy to make, just like last year\'s Zappa Utility Muffins.I opted to make the brain slugs themselves from gum paste, with royal icing eyes, and flower stamen antennae that I attempted to dye green with food coloring (and very vaguely succeeded in doing so). They are vanilla cupcakes from scratch, with some slightly grenadine flavored buttercream icing brains. And they were as tasty as the sweet, sweet fluids the brain slugs crave themselves!
because you can never have too much yarn porn. january 1, i started a 365 photo-a-day project. and, in consultation with many of your good selves, i created a&nbsp; flickr group &nbsp;to support it and for us to have a place to share our photos and give feedback to one another, with the idea of improving our photography. in the initial, heady days of january, it was so much fun! it seemed like the year would fly by and the inspiration would continue to flow like a fountain. all these people who knew one another from the blogosphere and a few new ones joined in and we became friends. and everyone learned and made explore and was happy. then february struck. most of those in the group live in the northern hemisphere, so it was the darkest, coldest, most dreary part of the winter and it was hard. now it\'s march and spring is taking its sweet time in coming, at least where i live. there are days when i look outside at the aging snowbanks and the bare trees and i think,\'i can\'t possibly take a &nbsp;picture of anything worthwhile today.\'but then i take a wander around the house or i look at the photos the others in the group have taken and i feel inspired by something someone else photographed, and i get through it. because i promised myself i would. and my promises to myself have to mean something. and you reach a point where you keep doing it BECAUSE it\'s hard and because doing things that are hard can be good for you, and because it makes you buy fresh flowers on a regular basis. my reasons for doing this have already changed in the 75 days it\'s been running. at the beginning, if i\'m &nbsp;honest, i wanted to show off my ability to take breathtaking pictures and develop more consistency in that. now, i realize that such a project is more about documenting what\'s going on in my life. and i admit that it\'s most decidedly not breathtaking on a daily basis. some days, i use my iPhone (thank goodness i\'ve got&nbsp; hipstamatic and camerabag and other apps to make that more interesting). when the weather gets good, i\'m going to use some of my film cameras (they\'re best at outdoor photos). i realized that a profound macro of the inside of my cat\'s ear doesn\'t actually help me document my life on a daily basis, so i\'ve worked at pushing myself away from those and towards things that will help me remember what was going on and what was important to me at a particular moment in time. i think ultimately i\'ll find that this project is about memory for me. the other reason i did this was to be more mindful of the world around me. to notice things. to see differently. last year at about this time, i got on a total eyeball kick , which i later realized was about my wanting to SEE differently. having to take a photo every day makes me look differently at the world. i\'ll admit it\'s hard for me not to see the current exodus from the group as a personal rejection of sorts, despite endless explanations to the contrary, but i\'m trying. and until i can forget about it, that\'s all i can do.in the meantime, it makes me quite sad to see people give up and leave us, whatever their reasons. but although i\'ll admit it shakes my conviction, especially because it\'s people i love and respect, i remain committed. after all, i read recently about a guy who took a picture every single day from 1979 \'til his death in 1997. now THAT\'s commitment. if you\'re not now totally put off the idea of taking a photo every day and you\'d like to join us, please check out the blog camp 365 group on flickr. it\'s never too late to start! - - - and the picture at the top? what does it have to do with all of this? well, it was one of THOSE days, where i took what felt like 600 pictures of the new yarn that i\'m going to use to make granny squares after kristina and ulrika teach me this coming weekend, and i wasn\'t pleased with how any of them turned out. but then, i played with them in lightroom and i think this one came out ok. a process that was good for me and which framboesa talks about very thoughtfully here . yesterday, in the flickr group, kristine had a shot of her passport and used it to tell the story of how she was soon moving on to her next assignment. i didn\'t have any idea what i was going to do for my photo, so i did one of those tribute shots , as they\'re called when you blatantly copy what someone did and give them credit. i located my old passport and my current one and, as can often be the case with these daily photos, took a little trip down memory lane. old on the left, current on the right my passports are fatter than your usual passport. and that\'s because both of them have had pages a,\'ed to them. twice. you\'ll also notice that my old passport was green. it was my first one and i didn\'t know that most americans have a blue one. i was\'lucky\'and got the green one during a very small window when they issued ben franklin commemorative passports. it\'s actually thanks to benjamin franklin that we all have passports at all, as it was his idea. the unusual green passport caused me no end of grief when i was traveling a lot in the balkans in the late 90s. border guards constantly questioned its authenticity and one guard at the turkish-greek border actually sai,\'dgreen passport, very bad, very ba,\'dand made a slicing motion across his neck. i was quite alarmed, but the conversation stopped there as that was apparently the extent of his english and my turkish was nonexistent. i\'ve survived to tell the tale, so i guess it wasn\'t really very bad. and i never did ever meet anyone else with a green one. as an american, you get stamped everywhere you go and you often need visas. the first passport filled up because the macedonian visa took a whole page every time and i had to have a new one if i popped down to thessaloniki for a weekend or up to belgrade for a coffee. it was early days after macedonia found themselves, rather to their surprise, with their own country, and it took them awhile to realize they could issue multiple-entry visas. i eventually got one of those, but not before they had used up ten pages of my passport. a number of countries - china and india come to mind - think nothing of taking up an entire page of your passport for the visa. and the visas are elaborately colorful and often feature shiny holograms. i guess they want you to feel you got your money\'s worth. on the bright side, they\'re usually good for a least six months, so you don\'t need a new one should you be sent those places again. &nbsp;i did use up two whole pages on indian visas, as i had to go there frequently enough that one expired and i needed another. (audible sigh.) the bulk of my travel occurred during the bush administration and i clearly remember standing in lines at passport control, concealing my passport, as i felt a little sheepish about being american during those years. i happened to be in the philippines when obama was elected and i very clearly remember the sense of relief (tho\' bush was still president) when i realized that i no longer had to hide my passport while i stood in line. on that occasion, people in line saw it and several actually smiled and gave me a thumbs up. with the incomprehensible debacle of health care reform (who would seriously not want to limit the influence of insurance companies on their personal health?) going on in the US right now, i\'m not sure i wouldn\'t actually begin to conceal my passport again if i were queuing today. many of the pages are covered in stamps that say\'k¯benhavn\'because i get stamped every time i come back into the country if it\'s not from scandinavia or the schengen countries. it tapered off because eventually, i knew all of the guys at passport control and convinced them to not to stamp me every time. i\'ve loved the travel opportunities i\'ve had through my various jobs. the job i\'m starting in april will not have so many travel opportunities, but i\'ve been thinking about it and i\'m really ok with that. looking at all of these stamps exhausts me a little bit. when i see the dates for the convoluted trip i took from copenhagen to singapore to heathrow to gatwick to budapest to constanza and back to copenhagen in one crazy week, it makes me tired. i hope companies today are using the possibilities afforded by electronic meeting software, rather than sending someone to give a 30 minute presentation in singapore on monday and the same one in romania on wednesday. i remember thinking it was all very exciting at the time (tho\' having to switch from heathrow to gatwick was madness and an example of how bad the travel agent was). but today, i wouldn\'t even want to do it. and i would probably have the good sense to say no, but in those days (sounds like long ago, but it\'s not even three years ago), i actually quite liked it and of course, felt i had to do all of the things that were asked of me. these stamps document for me how far i\'ve come not just literally, but metaphorically as well. i think i\'ve learned to say no to such madness today. and i hope that one good thing to come out of economic crisis is that employees aren\'t asked to do trips like that these days, because companies think twice before spending 40,000 ($7,300) kroner on such a ticket. i\'m going to lose my gold status on both SAS and KLM here in the next couple of months. and tho\' there was a time, not so long ago, when that would have panicked me, i\'m resting quite easily in the knowledge. the world is changing and times are changing and it\'s no longer environmentally defensible to pop over to london for lunch or take a private plane back from newcastle like we did in the mid-noughties. i loved those times and am grateful for all the places i\'ve been, but i\'m quite ready to stay a bit closer to home for awhile. and besides, taking the train down through europe is quite romantic. ~ i miss being in an academic environment. i miss the thrill of reading a really dense sentence and pulling meaning out of it that applies the world around me. i think it\'s why i used quotes from susan sontag\'s on photography on my 365 project photos during february . ~ husband looks like an entirely new person in his new glasses (must photograph him soon). but is it the glasses or his new job or our impending move giving him that glow? maybe it\'s all of it. ~ i learned that our new little samsung U10 HD flashcam can\'t really handle filming in the dimly-lit riding hall. ~ note: the flashcam doesn\'t violate the\'not buying things in 2010\'because i actually bought it back in december, but my sister only just sent it last week. ~ cleaning out the attic is like visiting a flea market and finding all kinds of treasures, only without spending any money. who knew we had all this cool stuff? ~ if you trip over a sweet little brass deer in the yard at a house you\'re contemplating, it\'s a sign, right? and if you accidentally take that little deer with you, it\'s not really stealing, right? since it was abandoned out in the yard at a house that stands empty? ~ one drawback of sunshine: it exposes just how much your windows need cleaning. ~ stieg larsson is sweden\'s answer to dan brown. only we won\'t be subjected to more of his hack writing since he died. but i\'ll admit that i like the characters of mikael blomqvist and lisbeth salander, so i (re)read on. sometimes, you just have to read trash. but arthur koestler\'s the ghost in the machine is next on my nightstand, so i shall redeem myself. ~ every day after husband and sabin leave, i think that i\'ll go back to bed, but i never do. and soon, i won\'t be able to, since i\'ll be headed off for work in an actual office myself. ~ sometimes i wonder if others can hear that ringing in my ears. ~ i packed marxism and theology books in the same box this weekend and wondered aloud if i would be going to hell for that (tho\' thankfully i cannot, since i don\'t believe in hell and it\'s like santa claus, if you don\'t believe it in, it doesn\'t believe in you (thanks gwen )). husband\'s response:\'god is more of a marxist than you think.\'and the more we discussed it, the more i think he\'s right, there is something of the new testament over the communist manifesto . i wish i\'d written my dissertation on that. of course, i still could, since i haven\'t actually written it. yet. ~ i tucked all those little end bits of yarn into my scarf last night while watching hercule poirot (who is so gay, by the way, not that there\'s anything wrong with that). it was much easier than i thought it would be. now i hope i can figure out how to join the ends together when the time comes to do that. ~ i really wish i was on my way to the bookstore with trinsch &nbsp;this morning. she\'s going to browse books on new media and then she gets to write about it. i\'m so envious. it leaves me positively longing for academia. ~ i do love these little random thought downloads, they just completely clear my head and leave me feeling ready to face the week. pondering happiness quite a lot in the face of the excitement of moving to the other side of the country (which admittedly is like moving from one side of wisconsin to the other and not as big as it might sound). husband is like a little kid anticipating christmas. he actually fell asleep last night with a smile on his face. he\'s covering reams of paper with sketches of the possibilities for renovations. we\'re now betting on two horses, as it were, and have given an offer on a second place, since the dog sled transport to northern canada is apparently unreliable, or else the laid back realtor hasn\'t actually sent a dog sled or any thing else, as we\'ve heard nothing regarding our first offer. not being ones to wait around, husband has now talked himself (and thereby both of us) into the second place being better anyway. and he\'s right, there are more possibilities for ripping out everything that\'s there and putting it back in as we would want it. now betting on this one as well. what\'s cool is that there\'s a lake on the property. and although the first thing it needs is a new roof, that does afford opportunities not afforded by the other place, which recently had a new roof, although the engineering calculations surrounding that new roof are openly suspect in several places. so i think husband is right, the second property is better for us anyway. but my point actually is that even just talking about all of this is making us so happy. leading me to think about what happiness is. it\'s an eternal question, isn\'t it? and we\'re eternally in search of happiness, tho\' i\'m not sure we always recognize it when we see it. for me, it\'s something different than contentment. contentment is a mild, tame form of happiness. a resting, easy thing. whereas, what i think makes us happy, makes us really tick, is having some enormous, seemingly impossible, daunting project on the horizon. i can definitely see that in husband. he\'s transformed and positively beaming at the prospect of this project. of course, it\'s also his new job that\'s transformed him - he was more than a little bored and frustrated at work and just going through the motions. he\'s looking forward to his new job, but even more, to the new house and all of the possibilities it represents. these projects also remind me of our strengths - i can see things in my mind and he can build them. i pick colors, he paints them. in other words, i get all the fun and he does all the work. i guess i\'ll probably spend another summer with no kitchen, cooking on an old stove out in the yard and eating lots of salads. maybe it\'ll be time to try that raw diet i\'ve long wanted to try. perhaps it will clear my mind so that i\'ll make good choices on all of those colors that we\'ll need on the walls in the new house. whichever one it ends up being. at least the waiting paralysis of last week seems to have passed and an excited, expectant happiness has stepped in to replace it. and that makes me very happy. what made you happy this weekend? march 7 march 9 march 11 march 13 i\'m especially pleased with that row of yellow. it\'s some yarn i bought last summer at the viking fair in roskilde. it\'s hand-dyed with natural plant dyes - gyldenris as it\'s called in danish (not sure what that is in english). &nbsp;the colors are slightly less vibrant than this in real life. i\'ve got the saturation dialed up a notch (or two) in my camera at the moment. i should have bought the entire basket of this yarn dyed with natural plant dyes - - - &nbsp;a big congratulations to molly , my very first follower, and long lost sister in south africa.&nbsp; she just had a beautiful baby girl. latte and a fabulous norwegian cinnamon bun for stephanie of concerning: pancakes . i\'m back again already with another blog crush. i told you i had more of them brewing. this time, i\'m utterly charmed by stephanie\'s blog, c oncerning: pancakes . you may remember her from my tagging her recently for 7 random things . and while i\'m hoping she doesn\'t actually drink bud light with her peanut m&amp;m\'s, i very much enjoyed her list. stephanie first came to my attention because she has also decided to spend less in 2010 (tho\' i do believe she\'s taking a bit of a break at the moment, kinda like i did with the infamous orange coat incident). but thanks to the LinkWithin widget (love it now that they improved the code and hence the speed), i also found out that she\'s got a TLR camera &nbsp;and likes to play with TtV photography. her cat, chairman meow , has a clever name and is cute as can be. she often blogs about cooking , which is always a plus in my book. i\'m off to make her german pancakes now, since the pooka is home and feeling poorly. please do go check her out. around midmorning, right as i was putting the finishing touches on my to-do list, i got a monster headache. i blame the chocolate on toast that husband made me for breakfast. too much sugar, especially in the morning, will bring on a headache every time. it resisted all ibuprofen and the gallons of water i drank, so i finally took a nap. i couldn\'t even read, because it hurt too much to focus my eyes (there\'s that focus thing again). when sabin came home, i decided to hang out and watch project runway with her, despite the headache. while we watched the amusing catfighting and recriminations, &nbsp;i worked a bit on my knitting. and that\'s when i saw this little giraffe herd go by...do you think headaches can make you hallucinate? some snow melted, but not all. and hoarfrost on the trees. hurry up spring! we\'ve been waiting and waiting all week. and we\'ve realized that waiting bites. and instead of being productive and getting things done, the waiting paralyzes you and you stare into space and can\'t think straight and your arm falls asleep while you\'re knitting (is that supposed to happen?). you wander listlessly around the house, thinking about how much packing there is to do, but it doesn\'t really result in you actually doing any of it. Your mind wanders off to that dog sled that should have reached that guy you want to buy the house from wherever he is in the northern reaches of canada. you talked to the realtor yesterday, but he was as laid back as his accent and not at all worried that the guy hadn\'t answered yet. you asked in a slightly hysterical voice if they had in fact really sent a dog sled. he pretends he knows what you\'re talking about and laughs. it seems that your new job will start a whole lot sooner than you thought, which is both good and bad. because you haven\'t used your time all that wisely and now su,\'enly you won\'t have any. but on the other hand, it will undoubtedly be good for you to dress in normal clothes, fix your hair and put on makeup and go out among people on a daily basis. your photo-a-day project may suffer and focus rather too frequently on the wind turbine just outside your new office window. but time will tell. time will tell on all of it and time takes its sweet time. so strange how it can both crawl at a snail\'s pace and race by in the same instant. but time is mysterious that way. and life is full of contradictions.
Fifteen years ago, I was on my way to the Austin airport to catch a flight to New York City when the friend I\'d be staying with called and said that we\'d be attending a dance performance that evening in the East Village. Admission was free, she said, but the organizers requested a donation of two canned goods for a food pantry. So before walking out the door, I grabbed a couple of Ranch Style Beans as my offering. Ranch Style Beans are a Texan staple and they\'ve been satisfying people since 1872 with their take on classic chuck-wagon fare. It\'s a distinctive flavoróthe beans aren\'t fiery but they do have a depth and brightness that can be very a,\'ictive. When I lived in Texas, we ate them oftenóeither topped with cheese and rice, as a base to bean salad, alongside enchiladas or even in my mom\'s King Ranch casserole . But beyond the deliciousness and versatility of Ranch Style Beans, there\'s the appeal of that iconic black can with its distinctive Western-style font and illustration of a man with his tongue sticking out stating the beans are Appetite Pleasin\'. (Of course, the latter is a recent development for if you\'re as old as I am, you remember when the beans were Husband Pleasin\'.) I love that can and I\'ve read that if Andy Warhol had been a Texan he would have painted Ranch Style Beans cans instead of Campbell\'s Soup cans. I believe it. In the 15 years since I\'ve moved to New York City, I\'ve seen this city become more hospitable to fellow homesick Texans. We now have a Texan-style barbecue joint selling Kreuz sausages and excellent brisket; you can find Ro-Tel tomatoes at several grocery stores; dried and canned chiles are a common staple; and Austin-based Whole Foods is now here selling decent brands of tortillas, chips and salsas. But despite the advances this city\'s made, there\'s still one thing missing: my beloved Ranch Style Beans. To help with the drought, every time I go home I load up on a few cans. And my mom has even been known to put them in my Christmas stocking, which is always a very welcome gift. But when I recently came to my last can with no trip home in my immediate future, I realized that I should just figure out how to make these beans on my own. The recipe is a closely guarded secret, so I was flummoxed on what to do. And then I read one fan\'s observation that Ranch Style Beans are simply pintos swimming in a chili gravy. At last, it all made sense! I decided I\'d cook a pot of pintos in a chili gravy and see what happened. When making my chile gravy, I used the ingredient list on the back of my remaining can as my guide. Sure, there were some vague terms, such as \'spices\' and \'natural flavor,\' but the basic building blocks were in the open: tomatoes, chile peppers, paprika, vinager and beef fat. And of course, pinto beans. Even though the can didn\'t specify what type of chile, I went with anchos as they\'re the base of your common chili powder. I rehydrated the anchos and then blended them with some tomatoes, vinegar, cumin and paprika. And instead of beef fat, I opted to use beef broth instead. While the beans cooked, the house smelled gorgeous and the broth tasted right. But it wasn\'t until after a few hours when I ladled out a bowl that I realized that this bowl of beans far exceeded my expectations. I threw in some sour cream, warmed up a flour tortilla and had a most satisfying meal. And even though it\'s been 15 years since I gave away those beans, I\'ve often wondered if the New Yorker who ended up with them enjoyed them. I hope that they did. Ranch style beans Ingredients: 16 oz. of dried pinto beans 6 ancho chiles, stems and seeds removed 6 cloves of garlic, minced 1 onion, diced 1 15 oz. can of tomatoes (or 2 medium-sized tomatoes, peeled) 1 teaspoon brown sugar 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar 1 teaspoon paprika 1 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon oregano 1 cup of water 6 cups of beef broth Salt and black pepper to taste Method: Soak the beans covered in wateróeither overnight or the quick soak method in which you place the beans in a pot, cover with water, bring to a boil, cover and remove from heat and let sit for one hour. Drain the soaked beans. In a cast-iron skillet heated up to medium high, cook the anchos on each side for a couple of minutes (or until they start to bubble and pop), turn off the heat and fill the skillet with warm water. Let them sit until soft and rehydrated, which should happen after half an hour or so. In the pot you\'ll be cooking your beans, heat up a teaspoon of canola oil and cook the onions for ten minutes on medium. A,\' the garlic and cook for another minute. Throw the cooked onions and garlic in a blender and a,\' the tomatoes, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, paprika, cumin, oregano, water and hydrated ancho chiles. Puree until smooth. A,\' the pinto beans and beef broth to the pot and stir in the chile puree. On high, bring the pot to a boil and then cover; turn the heat down to low and simmer for two and a half hours, stirring occasionally. At this point, I check my beans for tenderness as depending on the freshness of the beans I find that the cooking time can be as short as two and a half hours and as long as four hours. When you\'re satisfied that the beans are done, salt and pepper to taste. Feeds four to six. Notes: If you can\'t find dried ancho chiles, you can substitute either ancho chile powder or regular chili powder. I\'d use 1/4 of a cup. These are not fiery beans, but if you want a bit more heat I\'d throw in a bit of Cayenne. And I always a,\' a pinch of baking soda to my soaking beans to help with digestion issues. You may do the same. ----------------- Are you on Facebook? A reader recommended I set up a Homesick Texan fan page, so I did. Please stop by and feel free to share links, upload photos or just say howdy! Homesick Texan fan page If you were in Houston in the 1980\'s, it was hard to escape the ubiquitous tacos al carbon. Ninfa Laurenzoóof the eponymous Ninfa\'sómade them her signature dish and as with her green sauce , many Houston Mexican restaurants soon a,\'ed these tacos to their menus as well. Tacos al carbon became a defining characteristic of Houston Tex-Mex But what exactly are tacos al carbon? The term al carbon is the Spanish phrase for cooking over coal, so you should expect grilled meats inside a tortilla. If you have tacos al carbon in Mexico, you will indeed find a variety of meats wrapped in either corn or flour tortillas depending on where you are geographically. But in Texas tacos al carbon came to mean one thing: cuts of grilled beef, nestled in a fluffy flour tortilla . But wait, isn\'t that a fajita? Now this is where it gets confusing. So what\'s the difference between fajitas and tacos al carbon? As I understand it, very little. Fajitas, which translates to little belts, are traditionally made with the tough diaphragm cut of beef known as skirt steak, which is a long and narrow, much like a belt. The meat is often marinated and then grilled or gri,\'led, and it\'s served with a prescribed array of condiments such as guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream and a stack of flour tortillas, all used to roll your own tacos. And yes, you can make fajitas, the dish, out of shrimp or chicken, but since the word itself refers to the cut of beef, technically it should be called something else. Tacos al carbon, however, can be made with any type of meat, not just the traditional skirt steak. And unlike fajitas, the tacos are already made instead of being a do-it-yourself affair. I think this is the main difference, but even for me it\'s a bit of a semantic stretch. Small differences aside, I still prefer tacos al carbon to fajitas. Sure, fajitas are a quite the spectacle, but sometimes you crave a more refined presentation. (Or perhaps I prefer tacos al carbon because I burned myself on the sizzling fajita skillet one too many times!) But no matter how you serve it, it\'s hard to resist a fresh flour tortilla wrapped around succulent beef so flavorful you can eat the two together unadorned. I live in a small apartment without any outdoor space so there\'s no cooking over coal for me. But if I get my cast-iron skillet hot enough and then slide my steak under the broiler, I get a nice charred crust that\'s almost as good as what I could get on a grill. So yes, technically these aren\'t true tacos al carbon (they\'re more like tacos a la plancha, which means tacos of the gri,\'le). But I don\'t mind because after one bite I\'m back in that little restaurant on Navigation where the beef is juicy, the tortillas are soft and the green sauce is plentiful. Tacos al carbon, small-apartment style Ingredients: 2 pounds skirt steak Juice of 4 limes (about 1/2 cup) 4 cloves of garlic 1/4 cup cilantro 1 jalapeno 1 teaspoon cumin 1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 teaspoon of canola oil or nonstick cooking spray Four green onions (optional) Method: To make the marinade, in a blender mix all the ingredients except for the skirt steak, canola oil and green onions. Pour over skirt steak and let it marinate for 2 to 8 hours in the refrigerator. Before cooking, rinse off the marinade and let the steak come to room temperature. Heat on high for 10 minutes a large cast-iron skillet or grill pan (you may have to cut the steak in half to fit). Also, turn on the broiler in your oven. When the skillet is hot (to test I throw in a drop of water and it should immediately evaporate), grease your pan with either the oil or nonstick cooking spray and a,\' your steak. Cook on one side for two minutes then turn and cook on the other side for two minutes. After it\'s cooked on both sides, place the green onions in the skillet with the steak still in it and place the skillet under the broiler for two minutes. Remove steak from pan and let it rest for 10 minutes. If onions aren\'t charred enough, slide the skillet back under the broiler. After meat has rested, slice the meat against the grain and roll in fluffy, flour tortillas with green onions on the side. Serves 4-6. Notes: I don\'t have a grill or outdoor space, so I don\'t know as much as I\'d like to about the subject, but to cook the steaks truly al carbon, I\'ve been told five minutes per side should do the trick. --------- Homesick Texan has been nominated for best regional food blog in Savuer\'s First Annual Best Food Blog Awards.

Please be sure and check out all the excellent blogs nominated--it\'s quite a round up! And if you\'re so inclined I\'d love your vote, which you can place right here . Thank you! I\'m roasting chiles and frying up bacon. What am I making, you might ask? What everybody wants to eat after being ill for a few days: chipotle macaroni and cheese. With bacon, of course. OK, so this might seem a bit heavy for a re-entry into the land of the normal eating, but let me tell youóI\'m hungry! And while the best thing I can say about not feeling well is that your skinny jeans are su,\'enly a viable option in your wardrobe, in the end I\'d rather be well than ill. Though who wouldn\'t? But let\'s talk about chipotle macaroni and cheese, shall we? My family, much like yours I reckon, has always made homemade macaroni and cheese. Sure, we\'d have the box stuff on hand for after-school snacks or donations to the church food pantry, but in my house the real, homemade stuff was what was preferred. Mom makes her macaroni and cheese in a variety of ways, but my favorite is a casserole of pasta suspended in a luscious sauce comprised of egg yolks, cheese and heavy cream. And just when you think it couldn\'t be any more extravagant, she throws in diced, thick ham and tops it off with buttery breadcrumbs. Yes, this is an excellent dish, but because of its richness I only advise serving it on special occasions. When it comes to a more everyday, simple macaroni and cheese, I turn to a method I learned in the New York Times. This recipe requires little effort besides pouring cottage cheese blended with milk over dry pasta, tossing in some shre,\'ed cheese and baking it for an hour. No endless stirring a sauce or boiling a batch of pasta, which makes it a cinch to make. The Times version kept it plain, but I\'ve made it my own by a,\'ing chipotle and garlic. And I top it with bacon and cotija, which a,\'s contrast to the oozing cheese and soft pasta. I realize that my macaroni and cheese may appear decadent as decadent as my monm\'s, but feel free to convince yourself that it\'s a touch more healthy due to the cottage cheese and all. I do. But you know what? We\'re nearing the end of a long, cold winter and sometimes you just need to pamper yourself. And for me, comfort comes clothed in chipotle chiles, cheese and bacon. Chipotle macaroni and cheese with bacon (adapted from the NY Times) Ingredients: 2 cups of dry elbow pasta 2 cups of milk 1 cup of cottage cheese 1 chipotle chile in adobo 1 teaspoon mustard powder 1 clove of garlic, roughly chopped Pinch of cumin Salt and black pepper to taste 3 cups of shre,\'ed cheese, a mix of che,\'ar and Monterey Jack 1/4 cup of crumbled cotija cheese (optional, but delicious!) 4 pieces of cooked bacon, chopped 1 tablespoon of butter Method: Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Grease a 9-inch cast-iron skillet or a 9-inch square or round baking pan with the butter. A,\' the dry pasta. In a blender, mix together the milk, cottage cheese, chipotle chile, mustard powder, garlic, cumin, salt and black pepper until it\'s smooth. Pour mixture over dry pasta and stir until sauce is evenly distributed. Stir in two cups of the shre,\'ed cheese, cover the pan with foil and bake for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, remove the foil and stir the macaroni and cheese a couple of times. Top with the remaining 1 cup of shre,\'ed cheese and chopped bacon and cook for another 25 minutes uncovered or until brown and bubbling. Remove from oven, sprinkle with cotija and serve. Note: If you\'re not familiar with cotija cheese, it\'s a Mexican hard cheese that\'s like a cross between feta and parmesan. It\'s become increasingly more common, so you can find it at many regular grocery stores and Hispanic markets. And if you live in New York City, I found at Mexicana Bakery in Jackson Heights at 86-06 Roosevelt a wonderful cotija coated in dried chiles. Also, chipotle bacon jam might go dandy with this as well! The day before Ash Wednesday? Yep, I\'m a pancake eater. I grew up in an Episcopalian family and that\'s how we rolledóin warm gri,\'lecakes and cold glasses of milk. And even though most of my friends prepare for Lent in a more colorful style, old traditions are hard to shake and I still enjoy a tall stack of pancakes on Shrove Tuesday. Pancakes might not be shiny beads, feathered costumes, fevered dancing or boisterous singing, but they don\'t have to be completely boring. I\'ve been known to serve gingerbread pancakes , buttermilk pancakes, banana nut pancakes and chocolate chip pancakes. But to truly get in the frenzied spirit on the eve of Lent, Uncle Austin\'s coconut pancakes (more colorfully known as Uncle Austin\'s Mexican pancakes) are a definite must. When I was young, Austin would make these pancakes for us on special occasions. Their main attraction was their sizeóhe\'d make one pancake the entire width of a 10-inch pan. And you didn\'t even have to share this big babyóno wayóthis over-sized coconut pancake was all for you! But incredible heft aside, Austin\'s Mexican pancakes were sweet with fresh coconut, and some family members allege that there was chocolate and nuts in them as well. I asked Austin for his recipe, but he said that not only had he not made these in 30 years, but also that he never really had one. Instead, he just took my grandpa\'s basic pancake recipe and dolled it up a bit with the shre,\'ed coconut, chunks of brown sugar and extra pats of butter. Curious why they were known as Mexican pancakes, he admitted that there was nothing authentically Mexican about them, but it was very, very important to be listening to Tejano music, preferably loud, while making them. He stressed, however that the main excitement was in the flipping of the 10-inch pancakeóthe messier the better! If you\'re celebrating pancake Tuesday, why not try Uncle Austin\'s Mexican coconut pancakesóthey\'re far more adventurous than your usual buttermilk pancakes. And with the Tejano thumping and the pancake batter flying, it may be the most thrilling pancake supper you\'ve ever had! What\'s your favorite pancake recipe? Coconut pancakes (Uncle Austin\'s Mexican pancakes) Ingredients: 1 egg 1 1/2 cups of milk 2 cups of flour 1 tablespoon of whole-wheat flour 1 tablespoon of fresh baking powder 1/2 tsp salt 1/4 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup fresh shre,\'ed coconut Juice from one lime (about 2 tablespoons) plus 1/2 teaspoon of lime zest 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon 4 tablespoons of melted butter Method: Beat together the egg and the milk. Stir in the rest of the ingredients and mix until smooth. If too thick, a,\' more milk For regular-sized pancakes, pour 1/4 cup of batter onto greased skillet heated at medium low. For Austin-sized pancakes, pour about 1 1/2 cups to 2 cups of batter into pan. Cook for a few minutes on one side, until edges are brown and bubbles form in batter. Flip and cook on other side a couple more minutes. Makes about 12 small pancakes or 3 extra-large pancakes. Note: Chopped pecans and chocolate chips are an excellent a,\'ition if you like. Austin recommends serving them with pineapple and I agree. I also top my pancakes with yogurt, but honey or syrup would be dandy as well. And Austin didn\'t a,\' limejuice or cinnamon in his original recipeóthat was my doing. When I was invited to a party where Southern pork dishes were being celebrated, the decision on what to bring was a no-brainer: Mexican chocolate pralines. Now before you call my contribution a little o,\', let me explain myself. My first (and more obvious) choice was to make cookies with lard. I didn\'t have any lard on hand, however, so I went to the Union Square farmers\' market to pick up a tub. But a snowstorm had threatened to blanket the city and my preferred lard vendor wasn\'t there; clearly, I had to come up with another plan. I\'ve been spending lots of time lately reading old cookbooks. I\'m curious to see what our ancestors ate and to see when certain dishes may have come into the common culinary vernacular. When looking for inspiration, I recalled that I had recently come across an old Mexican-candy recipe that called for piloncillo (or brown sugar) to be cooked with water and a strip of raw bacon. Now, I know bacon in a dessert is a trendy thing these days, but I was intrigued to see it listed in a 100-year-old recipe. And while I didn\'t have lard to make cookies, bacon was easily attainable. In another cookbook, I had seen a recipe for Mexican-chocolate pralines. So for the pork-themed feast, I decided to combine the two thoughts and make Mexican-chocolate pralines with bacon. Making a first-time dish to share at a large gathering is always brave if not foolish. And while the flavor of these pralines was pleasing, the texture was too delicate. So instead of patties thick with pecans and bacon, I had broken chips and shards instead. My pralines looked sad. Plus you couldn\'t even really taste the bacon! But I was out of time and couldn\'t show up empty handed so I threw the pieces into a tin and headed to the party. I suppose my offering these praline pieces was the equivalent of a student who shows a failed project to a teacher to prove that she has at least tried to complete the assignment. I gave myself about a C for effort. But then a strange thing happened. While at the party, I witnessed people eating the Mexican-chocolate praline pieces. And they were smiling! With pleasure! So, with a little work I knew I could make the Mexican chocolate pralines into something special. Buoyed by my friends\' comments, the next day I attempted to make these pralines again. I threw out the bacon (even though it had been the primary impetus to make these in the first place), a,\'ed more nuts, let the candy cook longer and threw in some orange zest for a hint of brightness. And after an hour of letting the pralines harden, I had a long sheet of parchment paper lined with a fine batch of Mexican chocolate pralines. If you\'re looking for Valentine\'s inspiration, these take little time and effort to make but are very impressive (even when they\'re not entirely perfect). But you don\'t need a special occasion to eat them, as they\'re a simple pleasure that can be enjoyed at any time. Mexican chocolate pralines (adapted from Aprovecho ) Ingredients: 1 disc of Mexican hot chocolate, such as Ibarra 2 oz. of unsweetened baking chocolate 2 cups of pecans, 1 cup chopped and 1 cup whole 1 1/2 cups of sugar 3/4 cup of brown sugar 1/2 cup of milk 6 tablespoons of butter 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 2 teaspoons fresh orange zest or 1 teaspoon dried orange zest 1/4 teaspoon Cayenne pepper 1/4 teaspoon sea salt 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Tools needed: Candy thermometer Parchment paper Method: In an oven set at 350 degrees, roast the pecans for 10 minutes. In a large pot, melt together on medium heat the chocolates, sugars, pecans, milk, butter, cinnamon, orange zest, Cayenne and sea salt, stirring occasionally. Place a candy thermometer in the pot to monitor the heat. When it reaches 235 degrees, remove from fire and a,\' the vanilla and stir the pot for two minutes. There should be a bit of shine to the candy but the candy will be a bit more thick. Scoop pralines onto parchment paper. (If it\'s too stiff, a,\' warm water to mixture.) Let cool for an hour and remove. They will still be a bit shiny but will lose that shine after a few hours. No matter, they\'re still delicious! Depending on how large your scoops may be, this makes about 20 pralines. They will keep for five days. Note: If you want to a,\' bacon to these, I\'d fry up four slices, crumble them and stir into praline when you a,\' the vanilla. Growing up in Houston, I\'m no stranger to chicken and sausage gumbo. The city\'s close proximity to Louisiana\'s Cajun country insured that I knew plenty of kids with family names such as Boudreaux, Guidry or Hebert, whose parents often had a big pot of the chunky soup simmering on the stove. After an afternoon of riding bikes, you could walk into one of these kitchens, grab a bowl and ladle a portion thick with smoky, succulent meats over a pile of rice. Gumbo is good and during the cold months it was almost as prevalent as chili in my part of town. With the New Orleans Saints going to the Super Bowl for the first time, the decision about what to make on the big day is simple. Sure, quarterback Drew Brees may be a Texan but my Super Bowl plan is to cook a big pot of chicken and sausage gumbo. And while I\'ve long been a gumbo eater for some reason, however, I\'ve never been much of a gumbo maker. So when I needed advice, I turned to Ken Wheaton. Ken Wheaton, who lives in Brooklyn but hails from Opelousas, Louisiana, is famous in certain New York City circles for his gumbo. So much that when his editor caught wind of his prowess, he insisted that Ken include his recipe in his excellent new novel, The First Annual Grand Prairie Rabbit Festival . Ken\'s novel isn\'t a food novel, per se. Nope, it\'s a story about a confused Catholic priest struggling with his faith and vows. And while that may seem like a heavy topic, in Ken\'s hands it\'s a humorous, heartfelt story that will make you laugh and might even make you cry. But it will also make you hungry for both Cajun food and culture as Ken deftly captures small-town Louisiana life in all its church-going, Zydeco-dancing and gumbo-making glory. And yes, please note that there\'s also lots of swearing, drinking and rabbit-stew eatingóit\'s not a book for the easily offended. I won\'t get into plot particulars, nor will I delve into any other English-major mumbo jumbo that I probably knew at one point but have long since forgotten. But do know this: Ken is an expert storyteller who has an amazing gift of creating a sense of place. And if you\'ve been aching to spend some time in Cajun country with some colorful characters, his book will tide you over until you can enjoy the real thing. Of course, you can also satisfy your hunger by making a batch of gumbo. Because I like to tinker, I messed with Ken\'s method just a bit, but I followed his key rules to not a,\' tomatoes, mushrooms or carrots. And while the word gumbo stems from the Bantu term for okra, kingombo , I didn\'t a,\' that as well even though it\'s quite common to include it for both flavor and its thickening power. If you\'ve ever been intimidated by making gumbo, as I was, don\'t be. The hardest part is making the roux (which I now do in the oven so it\'s a snap) and waiting for the soup to be ready. And when you tuck into your bowl filled with a rich broth, smoky sausage and tender chicken, you\'ll be happy that you made a batch. Your friends and family will thank you, too. But enough about me, what are y\'all making for the Super Bowl? Chicken and sausage gumbo (adapted from Ken Wheaton) Ingredients: 1 four-pound chicken, cut into parts 2 pounds of andouille sausage, sliced 2 onions, 1 diced and 1 cut into quarters 10 cloves of garlic, 5 minced and 5 whole 4 ribs of celery, 3 diced and 1 cut into quarters 2 bell peppers, diced 4 bay leaves 2 sprigs of fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dry 1 bunch of green onions, green part diced 1 cup of canola oil plus a tablespoon 1 cup of flour 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon of filÈ powder plus more for serving Salt, Cayenne and black pepper to taste Method: To make your roux, in a large cast iron skillet, mix together the flour and the canola oil. Place in an oven set at 350 degrees, walk away and let it cook for two hours. No hovering, no stirring, no nothing! After a couple of hours, take it out of the oven and it should be chocolate brown. Now, you can also do it the standing over the stove method if you prefer, but I don\'t. While the roux is cooking, make your chicken and broth. First, season your chicken parts generously with salt, black pepper and Cayenne. Place the chicken parts in a large pot with the quartered onions, whole garlic, quartered celery, 2 bay leaves and 8 quarts of water. Bring to a boil and then simmer for an hour and a half, skimming any foam that rises to the surface. Take the chicken out of the pot and when it\'s cool, remove the fat and pick the meat off the bones and cut into pieces. (Be sure and save the bones for another round of stock making.) When the broth is cool, strain and throw out the vegetables. Remove the fat with a gravy separator or by the plastic bag method. To do the latter, you\'ll pour the broth into a quart-sized plastic storage bag and once you see the fat rise to the top, snip off a bottom corner and drain it until you reach the fat layer. Do this in batches. You should have about 8 quarts. Clean your pot (or get another big one if you\'re blessed with a large, well-stocked kitchen) and in the bottom of it heat up 1 tablespoon of canola oil. A,\' the diced onions and let them cook for 10 minutes. A,\' the chopped celery and bell pepper, cook for five minutes, stirring occasionally. Throw in the minced garlic and cook for a minute. Now stir in the roux and cook it with the vegetables for five minutes, stirring every so often. A,\' the chicken meat and half of the sliced sausage and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. If things start to get sticky, pour in some water or wine. Now, slowly whisk in your strained chicken broth to the roux, vegetable, meat mixture. Throw in two more bay leaves, thyne and the Worcestershire, bring to a boil and then simmer for an hour. At this time a,\' the remaining sausage and cook for another hour. Fifteen minutes before it\'s done, a,\' the minced green onions and filÈ powder and check to see if it needs salt, black and Cayenne pepper. Remove bay leaves and serve over cooked rice with file powder for people to a,\' to their bowls. Notes: This is a soupy gumbo. If you like it thicker, use less liquid and/or cook it for a lot longer than stated here. FilÈ (pronounced fee-lay) powder is ground sassafras leaves and a dash of it will also help thicken it. If you\'re feeling wild, replace the canola oil with bacon grease. Ken also a,\'s tasso (a Cajun ham) to his chicken and sausage gumbo, but I couldn\'t find that here in NYC. If you\'re in that predicament, however, Ken suggests ordering your sausage and tasso from his hometown butcher, Kelly\'s Country Meat Block & Diner (Toll free 1-866-948-MEAT). He says,\'I usually order pure pork sausage, but lots of people are fans of the half&amp;half (beef and pork). The andouille is killer. The tasso is awesome. They also have rabbits, too!\'Or he likes to use Bruce Aidell\'s andoille sausage, as he believes it has an authentic flavor. He also prefers cooking up only chicken thighs and skipping the whole broth-making step and just a,\'s water to the pot as he lets his pot of gumbo simmer forever. Do this if you prefer. Full disclosure: Ken\'s my friend and I\'ve been watching him write this novel for many years, so you can take what I say about it with a grain of salt. That said please know I would never recommend something unless I loved it and thought y\'all might love it, too. A friend and I were comparing notes about our favorite childhood treats. As I was raving about my grandma\'s chocolate pie , my friend said, \'So how\'s your grandma\'s chocolate gravy?\' Huh? Chocolate gravyóis that like mole, I asked. Nope, it\'s spooned on biscuits, she said. I had to admit that I\'d never heard of chocolate gravy; clearly I\'d been deprived. Curious why I had been denied the joys of chocolate gravy all my life, I called my grandma and demanded an explanation. \'Why don\'t you make chocolate gravy?\' I asked. She replied, \'Because I don\'t know what it is.\' I see. Apparently, my grandma was in the dark on this secret as well. My only consolation? At least I wasn\'t alone. So what\'s the provenance of chocolate gravy? Because I know everything, I assumed that if I hadn\'t heard of it, then it must not be Texan. I was wrong. I poked around and not only had my friendóa long-standing Texanógrown up eating it within slapping distance of Dallas, but other Texan friends had been eating it all their lives as well. I heard chocolate-gravy stories from friends as far west as Midland and as far south as Houston. Though friends who had grown up in Arkansas, Tennessee and Georgia had also indulged, so it\'s not particular to just Texas. But no matter, my family had been missing out on a very good thing. I needed to make up for lost time. A little research revealed that there hadn\'t been much chocolate-gravy recipe evolution over the years. The biggest schism I found in the chocolate-gravy community was whether to use milk or water as your liquid. I was surprised that no one had thrown some chipotle or bacon into their gravy, but actually this pleased me as it proved that chocolate gravy was indeed a classic that didn\'t need any tinkering. But enough about thinking, it was time to eat. I made my first batch and it was a deep, dark concoctionósmooth, creamy and thick. I sliced a biscuit in half and plopped some chocolate gravy on each half. My first bite revealed this gravy\'s pleasures. Its pu,\'ing-like consistency is pure comfort on a cold, winter morning. And while biscuits are in no way virtuous, their texture and heft prevents the gravy from sliding into total decadence, which is important as this is a breakfast treat after all, not dessert. Does chocolate gravy and biscuits replace my beloved chocolate pie? No, but I certainly wouldn\'t pass up an opportunity to pass an occasional morning with it poured on top of a biscuit. And am I the only one who didn\'t grow up eating this? No matter, I am very, very pleased to finally make its acquaintance. Chocolate gravy Ingredients: 3/4 cup of sugar 1/4 cup of flour 1/4 cup of cocoa powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 2 cups of milk 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 tablespoon of butter Method: Mix together in a pot the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, salt and cinnamon (can sift if it\'s too lumpy). A,\' the milk and while stirring cook on medium heat until it thickens. Stir in the vanilla and butter and serve immediately with biscuits . Notes: As you can see in the photos I topped mine with some chopped pecans. If you\'re not a purist, I highly recommend this; hazelnuts would be delicious as well. And if you\'re feeling extra spicy, go ahead and throw in a pinch of Cayenne or chipotle powder! And this is how fellow-Texan Shaw
After a year and a half off from racing, it was time to think about doing another tri. But since I\'m still dealing with some atrophy in my left leg, the idea of doing much running didn\'t appeal   even though I\'m a runner. I was just enjoying getting back into a more regular routine of training. I swear I missed my friends and the lifestyle more than the races   even though the races act as a big giant carrot to motivate me to train. In January, I had an epiphany on the way home from my Master\'s Swim workout. ëHey, if I can swim 3,000 yards now, maybe I can swim 2.4 miles by the summer.\' I kept that thought to myself for a couple of weeks. Then I confessed my crazy thought-slash-pipe dream to Sharkbait. And later that week, I asked my trail patrol partner, The Governor, if he thought I could ride my bike 112 miles by the summer. (He knows I\'m out of shape and I\'ve never done a century in my life.) And since, I can be really insecure sometimes I got three more second opinions. I asked my swim coach, Mary, 734\'s Dad, and my rehab therapist, Quinn, if they thought I could go those distances. No one hesitated   except me. ëShould I do it? Should I do it?\' After thinking about it another day, I finally hit the ëSubmit\' button. Game on. I\'m doing the Full Vineman Aquabike on July 31st. It\'ll be just like doing an Ironman without the 26-mile run-walk-ëtil-I-drop. It will give me a chance to really work on my triathlon weaknesses. And it will give me time to gain back all that quad muscle strength before I do some serious running and racing again. I\'m going long with the goal of getting strong. Last year, I saw an older woman with a walker enter the rehab pool. She had a t-shirt with big letters bedazzled in silver dots that said, \'FIERCE.\' That pretty much described the weather out here in the past couple of weeks. The music in our pilates class was interrupted by a tornado warning issued by the National Weather Service. We were dumbfounded. That doesn\'t happen in Southern California. If anything, we get waterspouts offshore. We used levity to hide our concern and joked about taking shelter under the reformer. When I got out to my car, there were two messages from 734\'s Dad. And by the time I got home, the phone rang again and this time it was my dad in Boston, sounding a tad agitated because he saw my neighborhood on the news. Turns out the tornado touched down two miles from my place. I had no idea. I downplayed the whole thing and said the news trucks always hang out for the waves and the pu,\'les in January. Ha, I had NO idea a truck and two boats had been flipped nearby. Roofs had been torn off and windows broken. I live near the beach with an ocean view. Watching the waves come in was like watching fireworks. I couldn\'t stop gawking at them. And in the mi,\'le of the night, if the wind howled a little too much, I ran into the living room   away from the windows. We had tons of people who came by our pier to assess the damage to the beach and take pictures of the ocean. Pictures that only told half the story. Because the sound that they made, the smell, and the way they shook the shore and the pier was nothing short of FIERCE. After only a half dozen Master\'s swimming workouts, I\'m starting to notice a few distinct changes. 1. I can swim a lot farther than I thought. Last night my training log calculated 7.59 miles so far this year. (In a perfect world, it would\'ve been 7.34, but Coach Mary pushed me to go longer.) 2. I\'m learning how to do swim strokes that I\'ve never really attempted before because no one ever made me or showed me how to do them. My backstroke isn\'t pretty, but I haven\'t caused any damage to my training partners yet. 3. I\'m cramping so badly during workouts that my body feels possessed after 1,500-2,000 yards. I figure my toes and calves are going through an adaptation phase. Or maybe it should be classified as hazing since this Master\'s group feels a bit like a sorority when we\'re laughing about our workouts in the locker room. 4. My laundry hamper is piling up a lot faster with big towels. 5. I\'m frequently reaching for those Swimmer\'s eardrops. 6. I\'m positively gi,\'y with endorphins after each workout. 7. My happiness quotient has gone way up. Sharkbait noticed a difference too. Near the end of Wednesday\'s workout, she called out to me from a couple of lanes away with a smile and a nod of approval, \'You\'re gliding!\' \'What?\' I replied. \'You\'re gliding!!\' \'Oh,\' I answered. A compliment on my swimming definitely takes a little while to register. I wondered, ëHave I ever glided before? And if so, when?\' There I go overanalyzing things again. Who cares? For one length of the pool, it happened. I had a witness. I\'m ending this post with a shout out to some of my favorite bloggers. This week\'s Six\'s Picks include the new Mr . and Mrs. James Walsh , Running is Funny , TriTawn , Steve in a Speedo?! Gross! (and his lovely wife Pharmie ). Last year, I reluctantly kept track of my workout log. I found myself filling in some of the blanks at the end of \'09 like it was the week before taxes. I pieced things together by asking for copies of my workout log at the gym and scanning my Garmin data. Sadly, most of my swim workouts never got recorded. I know I did a bunch of them with a pull buoy at the local school\'s pool. Enter the New Year\'s Resolution: be more consistent. That applies to everything from filling out my log on Fitness Journal.com to cleaning out the fridge. And with this resolution comes another (which I\'ve been working on for a few months), don\'t fret, worry or feel guilty about all the stuff that didn\'t get done. I\'m trying to focus more on the doing and less on the angst of what I\'m not getting done. I know I may slip from time to time on this one, but I\'ll keep plugging away at it. I\'m happy to report that 2010 is off to a great start. In the first 10 days of the year, I\'ve worked out on 7 days doing 7 different activities. And this afternoon, I think I rinsed out 7 old condiment jars and put them in the recycling bin. Seven (aka 734, the cat) will be so proud. Actually, he won\'t care as long as I hide 7 treats around the house to keep him occupied. I\'m savoring the holidays as much as possible. I know, I know, time to move on to the resolutions. I\'m stalling big time. I don\'t even want to take my tree down, but I will this afternoon. Suffice it to say, the holidays were just what I needed this year. Perhaps they should a,\' another Christmas in July just to stimulate the economy and raise morale. I don\'t think it\'s just me. Everyone seems to be in a better mood. I had a great time kicking back with my loved ones, finding gifts, wrapping them and all of that good stuff. And while I had to use more restraint than I would have liked this year, it was the thought that counted   both on the giving and receiving end. One of my favorite gifts came with this custom tag created by 734\'s Dad\'s brother Ken . How cool. It was attached to some tempo music, The Gorillaz Demon Days CD. My family, 734\'s Dad , and my training partners came through with some awesome gifts to get me in the mood to train. More importantly, they made me feel like an athlete again. Sharkbait gave me some cycling socks with autumn leaves to remind me of home and an assortment of gels and electrolyte drink mixes. TriDiver gave me some Pearl Izumi running gloves and a Triathlete license plate holder. My marathoner sister, Jane, gave me a nice running jacket. Ryan surprised me with a text, \'Hey, don\'t do anything stupid like renewing your subscription to Triathlete Magazine. Merry Christmas!\' And 734\'s Dad gave me everything on my wish list. Wow, how did he ever know? (That\'s right, I hinted big time.) When I opened the Finis Hydro Hip training tool, he said, \'Hey, I thought only maxi pads had wings!\' I know he secretly gets a kick out of seeing all the idiosyncrasies that go along triathlon training. 734\'s Dad\'s parents gave me a very generous check to pass onto the Challenged Athletes Foundation . They knew I would have liked to do Operation Rebound again last year at Oceanside. I was quite touched by that gesture. And one of my all-time favorite gifts came from Nikki, Sharkbait\'s daughter. Since the kid recently went through quite a growth spurt, I received her old TYR split fins. I heard good things about these fins. I\'m hoping they really improve my swim. I\'m also hoping that osmosis takes affect because this girl can swim 100 yards in 1:15. Yeah, I wanna swim like her! Hmm, okay I just don\'t want to be lapped by her. ëCause that wouldn\'t be very nice to do to \'Mealie Minnow\' would it? Uh-oh, I think I just signed up for my first swim race. Rumor has it, the kid reads my blog. When I arrived at the pool last night, it was about 45 degrees. If this steam and fog came off a big black caldron, you\'d swear it was some sort of witch\'s brew. A cold and holiday festivities kept me out of the pool for a couple of weeks. I was excited to get back in there. Coach Mary gave me some instructions for a set, \'Okay, I want you to leave on the :40.\' I suspect I wasn\'t quite that punctual, but I really have no idea. I was having a Lucy/Miss Magoo moment out there. I couldn\'t see the clock through the fog at the other end of the pool. I couldn\'t see how much time elapsed on my lap counter. And I was fumbling with my Polar to get it to stopwatch mode because I couldn\'t see the numbers on that either. Rather than draw attention to my inability to see, I just swam as fast as I could and tried not to dawdle too much in between. I swam until I had goose bumps on my goose bumps and my left calf and right toes cramped. Mary still made me do a cool down with a pull buoy. I knew she was right, but it sure didn\'t feel like I needed a cool down with the onset of hypothermia. I managed to go 2,050 yards. After a nice hot shower, Sharkbait invited me over to her house for some ham-and-split pea soup. Is there anything better on a cold night? It reminded me of snow days in Massachusetts, when school was cancelled and I could sled for hours in the backyard. When I arrived at her house, Sharkbait lamented, \'I couldn\'t see anything in that fog! I couldn\'t make out the clock or see the numbers on my watch.\' I felt so relieved that it wasn\'t just me. Now, if Barracuda could just come out with foggy night-vision goggles next. Aside from all the fun holiday celebrations, my absolute favorite thing this past week was getting back to the dirt. Some women like perfume. I like the smell of dirt. The sting of the crisp, cool air. And the sound of the reeds rustling in the wind. I got it all when I went for a trail run on the afternoon before Christmas Eve. It turned out to be 4.33 miles and it felt just right. I had to walk it in a couple of the steep spots, but overall I was able to run. And I\'m very happy to report that it didn\'t feel like I needed to borrow a lung. I was truly surprised that it felt that good. I did not expect that YET. So the day after Christmas, I did it all over again. Both days, I went out in my new XTERRA XR 1.0 shoes . They felt super-comfortable out there. No complaints whatsoever. On Sunday, I had my monthly trail patrol for the California State Parks. My third time back. Keith, the Governor, lead the way. I started out great and made it up a mile climb without too much trouble, although I\'m sure I was quite slow. When we hit \'No Dogs\' I couldn\'t make it up the second hill, and I didn\'t clip out fast enough. I didn\'t want to land on my knee and instead I kind of hyper-extended my left leg and fell backwards. Next thing I knew I was on the ground on my back with my Santa Cruz Blur stuck between my legs at an awkward angle. A little embarrassing trying to extricate myself and get back up, except no one witnessed it. Ha! Keith and Dan were already waiting at the top. Falling is just part of mountain biking. But I could feel the disparity in my quad muscle strength as I attempted the climb. It\'s a little bit of a bummer, but I know it will get better. It messed with my head for the rest of the ride though. We went on a new singletrack trail that was built with Keith\'s help while I was away   Ticketron. Normally, it would\'ve been no problem. Okay, maybe I would have popped off the bike in a couple of places. Instead, I walked a lot of it with my bike. The steep climb out of Deer Canyon usually called for some hike-a-biking, but I was doin\' way more hikin\' than bikin\'. When we arrived at the first stretch of single track on Fenceline, it was no problem, but the second stretch, I had to clip out so quickly and so often that I gave up and walked the rest of the way. My knee ached a little   enough to give up on the idea of doing a brick workout with a little run afterwards. I got through it. I went to places I haven\'t been to in a long time on my mountain bike. And I had a lot of fun hanging out with the guys. Dan thought for sure that he would slow us down. Nope, it was me. When we stopped for some nutrition, I mentioned that I really liked the Hammer Gel Apple Cinnamon flavor. I said, \'Wow, this tastes just like apple pie.\' Dan replied right back, \'Oh, I\'d need ice cream with that \' Which pretty much gives you the flavor of the conversation that went back and forth between three immature trail patrol volunteers. When we arrived back in the parking lot, we had a visit from 734\'s Dad who rode across a couple of mountain ranges to meet up with us and say \'Hi!\' What a guy! Next week, I get to do it all over again. Hmmm, maybe I\'ll take a different route. Would you believe Slow ën Easy? Yup, that\'s a trail. A winding mile-and-a-quarter fire road. I wasn\'t really sure what I\'d write about here after my knee surgery last winter. I knew I wouldn\'t have a triathlon season. I wanted to talk to others who came back strong after being sidelined. It was an idea that was kickin\' around in my head for a few weeks when the unthinkable happened. A dear friend of mine was in a serious ski accident and suffered a spinal cord injury, and a few days later a stroke. I felt helpless to do anything for him as he lay in the hospital. I decided to start a new series: Comeback Kids. I\'d do a new story every Friday for him, his family, and his closest bu,\'ies   for as long as he was in the hospital. That was the plan. I had no idea how I\'d pull it off. I put it out there and hoped for the best. And I truly met the best in the process. Friends, friends of friends, acquaintances, and complete strangers who were more than willing to do the phone interviews, email me pictures, and review their story drafts prior to posting on the big Friday deadline. They divulged some pretty personal stuff, some pearls of wisdom, and always some kind words for my bu,\'y. I\'d like to thank each every one of them once again. Hall of Fame Triathlete Karen Smyers who called me from a yellow cab in New York City on a business trip. Pro triathlete Joanna Zeiger who said, \'Don\'t quit with your rehab until you are satisfied with the results.\' Yes, she spent five hours a day doing rehab for her back injury. (She inspires me to keep doing two or three-hour workouts at my rehab gym.) My physical therapy aide and former NFL player, Erroll Tucker , who still encourages me during every weight workout. I\'d venture to say that every single one of these Comeback Kids has a lot of heart, but Dwight Kroening completed Ironman Canada after receiving a heart transplant and Wayne \'The Dead Guy\' Wright completed 50 Marathons in 50 U.S. States this October after undergoing a quadruple bypass. Dennis Tapp found a way to ride his bike across the country with the partial paralysis caused by five gunshots. Sterling Kwong completed Ironman Arizona after battling testicular cancer. Casey Kammel completed Ironman Coeur d\'Alene in unique style after being told he\'d never walk again. Andy Bailey came back from a life-threatening MRSA infection and amputation to compete in triathlons again (at the age of 70). Pitcher Kara Nilan returned to collegiate play after suffering a traumatic brain injury on the mound. My fellow rehab patient, Lydia , continues to bravely fight cancer on top of the severe back pain from her paragliding accident. And my dear coach, Beth Hibbard , became a pro triathlete after breaking her neck. Tawnee Prazak and Kevin Quadrozzi , I have little doubt that you\'ll both make it to Kona some day. My fellow trail patrol mountain biker, Jane , continues to inspire me as I hit the trails with a little trepidation these days. My friend Laurie shattered some bones in her foot doing an Irish jig, and completed an ultra-marathon less than a year later. Ken Stephenson helped me start this series off with a bang and his brother Brad helped me keep the streak alive. (Yes, there will be something nice for you under the tree, I mean in the fridge, this Christmas!) Some thought their stories and their injuries weren\'t that special. From where I sit, they were all special. Every day someone finds this blog because they searched Google for words like \'plica syndrome,\' \'broken collarbone,\' or \'tibial plateau fracture.\' I\'ve received thank-you notes from readers   from Colorado to France to South Africa   who have said they were inspired by your stories. You helped me immensely. You helped my friend and his loved ones. You helped keep this magical thing going for 18 weeks until my bu,\'y was discharged from the hospital. Last week, he started walking again with assistance. I look forward to the day when I can write his Comeback Kid story. Until then, I plan to write a few more of these stories in the year ahead. And I thank you for making all of these stories possible. Happy holidays!
I\'ve been thinking lately about what it is that draws a woman to a man and vice-versa? And is there really such a thing as love at first sight??I know for myself, there are certain things that immediately draw me in, and I\'m talking pure aesthetics....a great smile (nice teeth), engaging eyes, good skin, nice hands....to name a few. But love?? What is it beyond that immediate attraction that makes someone take a second and a third and a fourth look?People often say that they know within the first 5 minutes whether someone they\'ve met has boyfriend/girlfriend\'potential\'or not. I think what is more often the case is that you know instantly if someone doesn\'t have a chance, but not necessarily if they do. Personality is such a HUGE X-factor and it is truly such a variable that I think it\'s almost impossible to completely rule someone out without having a conversation. And what is an appealing character trait in one person doesn\'t necessarily carry the same appeal on another. Weird how that is....but when people overlook the fact that someone is rude, thoughtless, selfish, unkind, or disrespectful just to be with the bombshell or the handsome hunk, we know how long those relationships last  - not very!There are certain deal breakers however. Instant No-Can-Dos. Shorter than me? Nope. Unintelligent? I\'ll pass. Smoke cigarettes? Hell to the no! Now while I don\'t think I\'ve ever experienced love at first sight, I think I\'ve had lust, lol, but I would never rule out the fact that i
I don\'t remember the last time I had visited a grave on the Mt. of Olives. Yes, I\'d been to Ibrahim\'s home, but he lives in the neighborhood of the living.&nbsp; I guess I don\'t know that many holy people.&nbsp; The Mt. of Olives is the world\'s oldest and holiest Jewish cemetery dating from biblical times.&nbsp; Many holy rabbis over the centuries have been buried there.&nbsp; Even Madonna visited one of the Kabbalah rabbis, when she was here with the Kabbalah center.&nbsp; This past Friday, however, was the anniversary of my friend\'s son\'s death&nbsp;5 years ago.&nbsp; He had a rare genetic thing, which left him, since birth, severely handicapped.&nbsp; He never walked or spoke.&nbsp;&nbsp;When he died at the age of 14,&nbsp;he was buried in the Mt. of Olives in a special plot for holy children - those who never spoke bad about anyone.&nbsp; It is a special merit to be buried there because space is limited and is usually reserved for renowned rabbis these days.&nbsp; Legend has it that when the resurrection happens, people buried there will be resurrected first. It was tough on my friend to visit his grave.&nbsp; She lost a son.&nbsp; It is always tough for the living.&nbsp; She knows he is fine, not trapped in a very handicapped body.&nbsp; When she dreams about him, he even&nbsp;speaks to her - something he never did when he was alive.&nbsp; I looked around at the gravestones.&nbsp; Some were so tiny - the babies must have been a few days, weeks or months when they died.&nbsp; Someone pointed out that right behind my friend\'s son\'s grave were the graves of the two Holzberg children - the children of the Chassidic couple that was killed&nbsp;during the Mumbai massacre a couple of years ago by Islamic&nbsp;extremists.&nbsp; They had died of illness&nbsp;before the tragedy with their parents&nbsp;occurred.&nbsp; Now they have no parents visiting their graves - only a 4 year old brother and grandparents.&nbsp; After we read the psalms and the quorum of 10 men left, the mother and a few of her friends stayed on to sit and keep this young soul of her son some company.&nbsp; We listened to the mother grieve for her son, for her loneliness and some shared what they felt too. grieving for a loved one &nbsp;I felt serene and there was an atmosphere of contentment sitting around the little souls. tiny grave &nbsp;There were red poppies&nbsp;growing wild by unmarked graves.&nbsp; I looked at the Holzberg graves and told my friend&nbsp;that her son and this&nbsp;boy were now friends and learning chassidut together.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cellphones are expensive, but so necessary.&nbsp; I wonder how we managed years ago when we had to depend on pay phones to tell someone we\'ll be late, or make impulsive, last minute&nbsp;arrangements with friends and relatives.&nbsp; How inconvenient it all was, trying to find that quarter or whatever the cost was then.&nbsp; But my cellphone bill has been expensive of late and so I called up the competitor of my current cell provider.&nbsp; There are three major cellphone companies in Israel, Cellcom, Pelephone and Orange.&nbsp; I got a much better offer from the competitor, after complaining about my current cellphone provider&nbsp;so after a week or so, I got on the phone with my current provider and told them about the offer. Can they match it?&nbsp; Closely.&nbsp; They connected me with a special department called Customer Retention or something like that.&nbsp; I would get a new phone at 50% of the cost.&nbsp; I complained that their competitor offered me a free one.&nbsp; OK - then they\'ll give me a free one too.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; It sounded so easy! I went to their service store and waited nearly an hour to be seated with one of their reps.&nbsp; They wrote my number down on a piece of paper. I was number 218.&nbsp; Number 211 flashed on the screen but there was no customer.&nbsp; They probably got impatient and left.&nbsp; I could have been crafty and written the number 211 on the other side of the paper to be promptly seated - but I\'m too American.&nbsp; Or Canadian.&nbsp; I\'ll wait my turn, the way civilized people are apt to do.&nbsp; I finally got my turn.&nbsp; The sales rep gets my phone number and asks me questions.\'How much did they offer you?\'I asked -\'Isn\'t it on the computer?\'Yes, but you\'re a special case from the retention department.&nbsp; What exactly did they promise you?\'&nbsp; I told him.\'Yes, you\'re right\'he says - obviously regaining his eyesight, as what they promised was probably on the computer screen all along.&nbsp; I couldn\'t figure out why they were playing this game. About 5 minutes into this, a woman comes over to me&nbsp;with a typed up survey in her hand - asking me how the service is and how is the sales rep I\'m talking to?\'Isn\'t it o,\' that you\'re asking me how is he when I\'m&nbsp;right in front of him?|\'Give me a 10\'said the sales rep to me.\'Ok, I\'ll give you a 10, but if I find that you\'re saying \'ok\' to whatever was agreed on the phone and I get a totally different, more expensive,&nbsp;bill, I\'m coming back to rate you a 1.\'Don\'t worry.&nbsp; The new rate will show up on your bill.\'The new rate didn\'t show up on what I signed, and after I questioned him, he said it was standard.&nbsp; I\'ll get the new rate on my next bill because I was a\'special\'case.\'So in case you\'re lying to me, how long am I contracted to you?\'18 months\'Fine.&nbsp;That\'s better than the&nbsp;more common&nbsp;3 year contract. &nbsp;If they\'re a bunch of liars, I\'ll use my phone minimally and pay the minimum charge and after 18 months switch to another provider.&nbsp; For years, ever since we made aliyah, I was considered by my kids to be so uncool.&nbsp; After all, I&nbsp;am an immigrant, speak Hebrew with an embarrassing accent, plus my grammar is often wrong.&nbsp; I&nbsp;like Western music, Arabs, Arabic music, health food,&nbsp;go to a trippy synagogue in Jerusalem, invite non-Jews for Shabbat dinner, eat in different restaurants all the time,&nbsp;see foreign films and often&nbsp;go alone.&nbsp; My oldest&nbsp;daughter even bought me a birthday gift&nbsp;-&nbsp;a 10-movie package - at&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem\'s landmark&nbsp; Smadar theater.&nbsp; I love the Smadar.&nbsp; They didn\'t destroy the Ottomon-era terracotta stone floors and opened up a restaurant attached to the theater.&nbsp; Unlike the cinemateque, you can bring in your beer and cappucino or hot cider - even wine - into the theater.&nbsp; There are others like me who sit alone in the theater.&nbsp; Lately, I saw the movies Push and A Serious Man there.&nbsp; Next week I\'m seeing a Korean film with a friend (!).&nbsp; But now, all of a su,\'en, I\'m cool.&nbsp; My complainer daughter hardly complains anymore.&nbsp; She hugs and kisses me daily.&nbsp; The reason?&nbsp; She has a new boyfriend.&nbsp; This guy comes from a Moroccan family BUT, and here\'s a big BUT, he enjoys Ashkenazi (European/Western) culture more than his own. He doesn\'t listen to Mi,\'le Eastern music and is astounded that my daughter acts more\'Moroccan\'than he.&nbsp; It\'s something he has to get used to, he says.&nbsp; His brother is actually a famous Israeli singer, who still churns out Israeli hits.&nbsp; This new boyfriend loves the Beatles, Doors, Stones and Fats Domino.&nbsp; My daughter doesn\'t know the songs to any of these.&nbsp; But now she\'s coming to me to learn this new Western culture her boyfriend is into.&nbsp; She\'s now proud of her once-uncool mother.&nbsp; I know I\'m going to have to bring that photo of Ronnie Wood of the Rolling Stones and me together at an art gallery out of&nbsp; basement storage to impress him.\'You\'re gonna love my mother\'she coos to her boyfriend.\'you might even want to marry her\', she jokes, perhaps knowing a little of my Cougar fantasies.\'See?&nbsp; This is how it starts.&nbsp; First you eat like that, and then you start inviting Arabs into the house.\'griped my son-in-law, as I gave my daughter, his wife, some healing foods for her ulcerative colitis.&nbsp; Brown rice with broccoli and carrots, drizzled with flax seed oil.&nbsp; I was amused by his theory, wondering if it were indeed true. He shook his head.&nbsp; He truly believes that granola eating hippies, like his mother-in-law, weren\'t always loving and tolerant&nbsp;human beings, but turned that way when they eschewed mostly junk food for a healthier lifestyle.&nbsp; His wife was eating crap, like diet soda and fast food nearly every day, and the result is ulcerative colitis, which I\'m trying to help her heal through food.&nbsp; And if that will&nbsp;heal&nbsp;her body as well as her soul&nbsp;, then why not?&nbsp; Because she\'ll turn into me?&nbsp; Is that what he\'s afraid of?&nbsp; I laughed at the prospect of her turning into a peace-nik and inviting all the Arabs who live in Jabel Mukaber into their tiny West Jerusalem home, and him, another mi,\'le-east Archie Bunker, tearing his hair out. My son\'s school has been calling me all month trying to get me to come to another one of their\'emergency\'meetings about my son who shows up in school, but hardly in class.\'There are&nbsp;teachers who don\'t even know who he is!\'exclaimed his&nbsp;principal. I tell the principal\'s secretary that I can\'t make it on the Sunday she wants me to come because my boss has a slew of meetings that day, and I have to prepare her on that day.\'Isn\'t your son important to you?&nbsp; Don\'t you even care?&nbsp; Is your job so much more &nbsp;important than your own son?&nbsp; We made this meeting with a lot of people involved and that\'s when they could come!!\'&nbsp; The principal\'s secretary is actually screaming at me.&nbsp; I look at the phone.&nbsp; I\'m totally pissed.&nbsp; She continues,\'they want to throw him out of school.&nbsp; Don\'t you think that\'s important?\'I glare into the phone.&nbsp; Unfortunately, she can\'t see me gritting my teeth.\'You never asked ME when\'I\'can make it.&nbsp; Keeping my job is showing my kids how responsible I am.&nbsp; If I don\'t have my job, then we\'ll be living in the streets.&nbsp;I\'m not ready to sacrifice my job for a meeting in school.&nbsp; Sorry.\'I think she was shocked by my response.&nbsp; There was silence on the other end of the line. I&nbsp;continued.&nbsp;\'If you want to throw him out of school, it will just have to wait another week.\'I shouted back at the secretary.&nbsp; I made the appointment for the week after, when my boss will be out of town. That afternoon I went into the local mall where one of the shops was selling pillows.&nbsp; My kids were all sleeping on pillows that had seen better days.&nbsp;&nbsp;But that day, I was only buying for&nbsp;one of them.&nbsp; &nbsp;I ask her to show me a selection for my 20 year old daughter.&nbsp; The shopkeeper shows me a latex pillow that is the most expensive one in the store.\'It\'s quite a lot of money.\'I complained to her.&nbsp;\'I\'d like to buy her a mid-range one.&nbsp; Not the cheapest and not the most expensive.\'She looked at me funny.\'But it\'s your daughter!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn\'t she worth the best?\'I looked at the shopkeeper funny.\'Absolutely not.\'And then I walked out of the store, seeing the shopkeeper\'s mouth still open.... here in the Holy Land, we are basking in the sun.&nbsp; I usually don\'t like to make you people living with cold weather jealous, but today I\'ll make an exception. We ate at Bariba overlooking the Yarkon River and Reading plant Mullet fish over risotto in saffron sauce The best mushroom gnocchi I\'ve ever tasted covered with Parmesean foam (!) All sorts of people passed by That dog wants ice cream some people went boating some kids went swimming The Farmers Market was in full swing one of Hubby\'s favorite stores on Dizengoff Street with the latest fashion in undies (if you can call them that) Road signs wishing travellers a Shabbat Shalom I prepared so well, I thought, for the upcoming ticket sales in Israel for the Elton John concert in June.&nbsp; I read the reports&nbsp; of groups trying to get him to boycott Israel.&nbsp; Yawn.&nbsp; This is getting boring already.&nbsp; They do this to every celebrity who books concerts here.&nbsp; Most ignore the boycott pleas and threats.&nbsp; I hope Elton has the balls to pay no heed to these party poopers.&nbsp; Cancelling a concert will not make things better for Palestinians in this country.&nbsp; It\'ll just piss me off and probably a few other peacemakers too.&nbsp; But getting back to the tickets...Advance ticket sales were available to Bank Discount members beginning from 7:00 pm last night.&nbsp; I\'m a member (or rather my husband is) - even though that bank pisses me off - except when they give their members perks such as this.&nbsp; &nbsp;I called up the bank last week to make sure that&nbsp;my credit&nbsp;card was open and ok to accept purchases.&nbsp; After all, it has been over a year since I used it.&nbsp; The bank clerk told me that there is no problem with the card.&nbsp; Yesterday I called another bank clerk to get more credit in case I want to buy more than 4 tickets.&nbsp; He said everything is fine.&nbsp; Wonderful.&nbsp; I\'m ready. I did some errands then came back to the office at 6:45 pm and got the website ready on my computer.&nbsp; Of course by the time 7:00 pm rolled around, it took me 20 minutes to get onto the site.&nbsp; I finally got in.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yay!&nbsp; I filled out all the information they needed, picked out some fabulous seats in the front row on the side of the stage - very close to the stage, in fact - &nbsp;and then took my credit card out.&nbsp; I plugged in the numbers, my ID number, etc. and then I saw the expiry date.&nbsp; I look at the card - remember, I had been planning this for a week already - and the expiry date says 09/09.&nbsp; SHIT!&nbsp; I tried putting in a random expiry date, but the computer is smart.&nbsp; It doesn\'t take my card.&nbsp; I use the other Visa I have, but the computer insists I use the Bank Discount credit card.&nbsp; I leave the webpage open, just in case I never get in again because of all the people trying to buy tickets at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to think fast.&nbsp; I call up the credit card company.&nbsp; I\'m frantic.&nbsp; I\'m wondering if there are more frantic people calling them about Elton John.\'Look, I\'m trying to buy Elton John tickets, and my visa date expired.&nbsp; Can you give me a new updated date?&nbsp; Please?\'It&nbsp;seems hopeful at first while the clerk puts me on hold probably to speak to his manager.&nbsp; He comes back on.\'Sorry. You have to speak to your bank about this.&nbsp; We don\'t give new expiry dates.\'But my bank doesn\'t open until 8:30 in the morning\'I wailed.\'Can\'t you give me a temporary one?\'No.&nbsp; I\'m so sorry.\'&nbsp; He really sounded sympathetic.&nbsp; But there was no point in arguing with him.&nbsp; I had to think quickly while the ticket sales website was still on the payment page.&nbsp; AH!&nbsp;&nbsp;I remembered that a good&nbsp;friend of mine has a Discount Visa.&nbsp; We tried doing this together, but she had a difficult time with the Hebrew instructions.&nbsp; I guided her through but the transaction failed.&nbsp; She doesn\'t have enough credit on her card. Never give up.&nbsp; My Complainer daughter has to do something good for her mother, doesn\'t she, instead of chronically complaining all the time.&nbsp; I call her several times.&nbsp; She doesn\'t answer her phone.&nbsp; It\'s 8:00 pm, and no tickets.&nbsp; I go out for dinner with friends.&nbsp; My daughter calls and apologizes (!). She was working and couldn\'t answer her phone, but if I\'m in town, we can go home together. Yes, and I could take your Visa, I thought.&nbsp; She didn\'t complain when I asked her for it.&nbsp; Not a flinch.&nbsp; When I arrived home after midnight I went into my son\'s room where the computer is.&nbsp; I let him rant and rave about me making noise.&nbsp; I tried to bribe him with concert tickets but he\'s not interested.&nbsp; I finally get into the site.&nbsp; Most of the great seats are gone - except for the very expensive lawn seats.&nbsp; I get a gate close to the stage, but 23 rows up.&nbsp; Not bad.&nbsp; Not as great as I could have gotten had I had an updated credit card, but they were good nevertheless. So Elton, hang on....it\'ll be a rocky road with every asshole trying to get you to cancel the concert.&nbsp; Don\'t listen to anyone.&nbsp; Just do what you have to do so we can all have a great time together.... Be careful who you start conversations with standing at bus stops.&nbsp; It\'s not like people are dangerous here.&nbsp; They aren\'t.&nbsp; And it\'s easy to jump into a&nbsp;stranger\'s conversation.&nbsp; The stranger who is talking usually looks around and talks to whoever is standing around.&nbsp; Some are receptive and sometimes one can engage in fun conversation about all sorts of things while waiting for the bus. So yesterday I jumped into a bus stop conversation about People.&nbsp; Persian people and then Russian people.\'Not all of them are bad\'said a woman to a man.\'You always get one bad apple in the tree\'the man answered. I interjected in Hebrew,\'Well, what do you think about Canadians?\'Bad move on my part.&nbsp; The man continued his tirade all throughout the 40 minute bus ride with me about his Canadian neighbor whose dog barked outside every&nbsp;day at 4:00 am.&nbsp;\'I told her I was going to kill the dog.\'&nbsp; He leered at me.&nbsp; He clearly isn\'t too fond of Canadians.&nbsp; Then he went on about putting talcum powder on the floor and I couldn\'t understand half of what he was saying.&nbsp; I really just wanted to relax on the bus ride home and not talk to anyone.&nbsp; I got home and tried to make dinner.&nbsp; The two men in the family began bickering.\'Who ate my cookies?\'demanded Hubby.&nbsp; Someone at work made chocolate chip cookies for me&nbsp;for my birthday&nbsp; I brought them home and told Hubby that they were for him for HIS birthday this week.&nbsp; He was so happy.&nbsp; Before the cookies were eaten, that is.&nbsp; My son admitted to the crime.&nbsp;\'There were only 10 left!\'10!!!&nbsp; YOU ATE ALL 10???? YOU PIG!!!\'and a war of the words started, with name calling back and forth, which ended up with my son throwing Hubby\'s files out of our son\'s room, where they are kept, and then Hubby taking the computer monitor out of our son\'s room and putting it into our locked storage room. And then I thought it is much easier dealing with strangers on the bus, who can talk the ass out of a turkey, than this. It was bad enough when the water stopped running right before the Sabbath.&nbsp; I was about to put on the slow cooker a dish called Hamin, which takes overnight to cook, and consists of everything basically - meat, chicken, beans, potatoes, stuffing, barley, and seasoned either sweet or salty or mi,\'le eastern.&nbsp; The water shut off just as I was about to wash a bunch of scallions.&nbsp; I was horrified.&nbsp; I ended up washing the scallions in a pot full of water that had cooked the artichokes.&nbsp; I felt good.&nbsp; I was recycling.&nbsp; The neighbors kept on going onto the roof to see if they could fix the water thing (whatever it\'s called),&nbsp;while the rain was pouring down at the same time.&nbsp; For a few minutes they were successful and then --- no water from the taps.&nbsp; Again.&nbsp; We thought of a weekend with toilets full of shit and family members in sore need of a shower.\'I have my PERIOD!!\'shouted one of my daughters during the meal.\'What\'s a period?\'asked my bright 18 year old son.&nbsp; He had no idea what that word meant in English.\'YOU tell him\'I ordered my son-in-law. But before our meal, while this water shortage thing was going on, I had smelled smoke coming from the air vents.&nbsp; I panicked because Hubby was over at my married daughter\'s house in Jerusalem and called the fire department.&nbsp; Two men came into the house, looking like professional ...ghostbusters or whatever.&nbsp; Oxygen tanks on their backs, contraptions which measure or find the source of the smoke.&nbsp; The odor was quite strong.&nbsp; They were with me in the apartment for a good 20 minutes.&nbsp; Then I lift up one of my pots that was on the stove and see a little rattan coaster sticking to the bottom of the pot.&nbsp; It was burnt to a crisp.&nbsp; I found the culprit and I felt so stupid.&nbsp; The firemen looked at me and smiled.&nbsp; They must go through this often, I thought&nbsp;(perhaps others would be as mindless as myself). Meanwhile, Hubby returned as the men were leaving.&nbsp; He didn\'t care if the house was burning - he was just thrilled to be able to eat&nbsp;on paper plates, as his dishwashing duties was temporarily suspended.
the Novelista Barista today featured me in her blog. I am extremely flattered by what she had to say. Take a look!A \'catch-up\' post is on the way, probably tomorrow... watch this space! x When I\'m in Malta, I generally avoid shopping like the plague. Not only are most prices higher, the Euro isn\'t exactly in my favour either. But last time I was there, I was determined to get my hands on the new Chasing Pandora CD, The Driver and the Dancer. And ever since then, I haven\'t really been able to turn it off. The Distance Between Us is one of my very favourite songs off the album (although I love them all, which I cannot often say about an album). Unfortunately I haven\'t been able to find the video online, but the entire CD can be heard (free!) on their website. musically,
A,\'ed in a couple of items to the Tiny Lifestyle Changes today. One I\'ve been doing for a while and it is working well for me. The other is a suggestion made by my associate rector, Matt, and it\'s the kind of thing that would work for me if I did it regularly so I\'m going to make the attempt to do that too. The one that I\'m already doing is from my pastoral counselor. He suggested that to handle stress and anxiety, since it was keeping me awake at night, I should turn over to God the things that were bothering me most. He suggested a journal, but I\'m just doing it in prayer. I\'ve been negligent of my prayer life, so this is a good way to get back in the habit of talking to God. When I was a new believer I used to fall asleep reading his word. I sort of miss that comfort and I hope this tiny step will lead me back to that, or at least to more consideration in the quiet of the evening when I\'m lying there trying to shut down my day. Last Sunday Matt gave a really good sermon on that included 2 midrash. That\'s may not be spelled correctly and it\'s not the plural form. He told us during the sermon but I didn\'t get that bit down. One of the midrash talked about the space between the lines of text in the Torah being the place where the true meaning was to be found. Then he talked about the name of God as it is in Hebrew YHVH, which is never spoken, and what the sound might be if we did try to pronounce it. Without the vowels that Christians have a,\'ed in it sounds sort of like breathy sounds that one hears. The PH sound, the H sound, maybe some of the S, those where you are exhaling strongly. I kind of laughed when he first did that and tried to say it without the vowels. It sounded like a bit from Harry Potter. Then as his lesson continued I came to think, the breath sound might represent the breath of life that God gives us or that energy which was sent forth from God when he made the world. If that\'s what we find in the quiet spaces maybe it\'s a good idea that I go back and reread my priests\' sermons so that I can reflect on their teachings and gain what is between the lines of text. And that\'s the second item I a,\'ed into Tiny Lifestyle Changes. Peace! Hope! &amp; Joy! If you\'ve read my blog a lot in the past you know I like to think back on things and see what effect they\'ve had on my life. This is a skill I learned late in life. It was something I had to do for some college classes and believe I\'m much the better for having gained it. The process was called reflection. Reflection has given me lots of awareness on how things affect others too. When I was a child I didn\'t spend time analyzing other people\'s actions or emotions until it affected me and then it was usually a frenzy of trying to look at why they did or said whatever it was that had hurt me so badly. That\'s not socially helpful, but it let me express my angst till I\'d owned it and come to a better understanding of the situation. Thankfully I\'ve grown some since those anxious teenage years. These days I try to understand the other person\'s needs or behaviors based on what I know of them and not how I feel. It helps a bunch because I\'ve come to love harmony in my life, a gift from Mom, and hopefully that longing for peace and harmony makes me more of a peacemaker than an irritant to any situation I run into. This morning I was reading an article from WebMD that talked about a study researching the effects of darkness on people\'s behavior. It said that when the room is darkened, not lightless but dim light, or people wore sunglasses they might behave in a less ethical manner. I found that very interesting and su,\'enly I was imagining what I might say to a child who wanted to wear sunglasses all the time because he, \'thought it made him look cool\' because another kid he knew wore them and he thought that kid was cool. I guess our teachers were right; you shouldn\'t wear sunglasses all the time. Since the eyes are windows to our heart and mind, if someone feels you can\'t see what he\'s thinking or feeling he feels anonymous and can thus act in ways that might not be right but won\'t be attributed to him because of that self perceived anonymity. I think I can understand how a kid might want to be anonymous if he\'s constantly being corrected for things he does. We probably all experience times like that as adults too. But knowing this means it\'s important to look people in the eyes to really know them, that it can\'t be done by just hearing their words without knowing the emotions behind them, or maybe the experiences that have generated their response to a situation. That\'s not always easy to know even when you do look someone in the eye, but it gives you the opportunity to ask them for more so that they can express themselves and feel heard. I think that\'s called active listening today and we all know how much we want to be heard when we are struggling. I want to go back to that darkness article and think up some more ways that it can affect us so I guess I\'ll find a friend I can discuss that with, or maybe my counselor since he\'s good at role play too. If you read the article on darkness and come up with any insights I hope you\'ll share them. Peace! Hope! &amp; Joy! It\'s true! I\'m almost gi,\'y I\'m so happy. This isn\'t because of anything that\'s happened. No major event triggered this. I think it\'s the result of some small changes I made in my routine recently that have just triggered a good feeling within my spirit. The changes I made were very small. I\'ve been dealing with depression ever since my marriage broke up in ë99. I have a good counselor and maybe a very smart psychiatrist who prescribes my medication. So for the past 3 days I\'ve been on a very small dose of Bupropion. Just 100 mg a day, extended release. This dose is small enough to not cause that edgy feeling that this drug is known for but it helps lift my spirits. I think it is taking effect. But I don\'t think that alone has triggered this surfeit of happiness. The next change I made was last night\'s routine. It was cold in the apartment so I took out time in the mi,\'le of the evening to draw and take a warm bath. I washed my hair and when I was through I put on comfy clothes and went to bed at my usual time, hair still wet but combed. When I woke up this morning I had more time in my routine to do stuff I wanted to do instead of feeling the need to get ready for work. My hair was dry and fluffy, call that wash and sleep. LOL More time gives you a relaxed feeling about your day so that\'s going to become a more regular change I think. Bath at night and ready faster in the morning. Plus I think I slept better for that. Good sleep gives me a much better mood. Then I elected to dress comfortably for work. I work in a business casual environment and some of my coworkers wear suits. I would have loved jeans today but it\'s not jeans day so I pulled out an old pair of loose fitting pants that still looked good and topped them with one of those thin flannel shirts that gives you lots of room to move. A,\'ed a belt and I\'m ready for for anything and can move comfortably without care to whether I\'m sitting like a proper lady and feeling cu,\'led in that flannel. I think that finished the mood lift. So clean, rested, comfortable, and ready to face the day. I attribute some of this to the Happiness Project . And I\'m going to continue to read that blog because I keep finding good suggestions in it that lift my mood. Hope your day goes as good as I anticipate mine will. Peace! Hope! &amp; Joy! Even though they\'d been sniffing noses through the screen door and seemed interested in being friends, when I adopted Hooboo, rescuing him from his \'stray porch kitty\' status, he and Hyram developed an instant competition. They fought, Hyram stole Hooboo\'s food, Hooboo would steal the wrap around my ankles time, and they\'d rarely share a bed together. Hyram actually kept watch for Hooboo\'s arrival and left when he entered the room. That is until recently. I don\'t know what changed but for the past two nights I\'ve had both cats on the bed. Sunday night it was one on either side of me. Last night they were actually sharing the comforter and less than a foot apart. Dare I hope that I\'ve now got a cat family? In other news I\'m fighting a cold and it\'s taking its usual course. Following a nurse friend\'s advice I was trying to \'let it run through me\' and avoiding decongestants until the need for sleep precluded that and I gave in. Prayers for health are appreciated. Peace! Hope! &amp; Joy! Recently I updated to the latest (greatest?) version of Firefox, that being version 3.6. It immediately disabled IE Tab and one or two other extensions a.k.a. a,\'-ons. Oops! I\'d been using IE Tab to see my blog because I thought there had been a problem with Firefox and Blogger. I\'d been losing the right hand column of my blog in Firefox and IE Tab was my current workaround. Then last night I opened and read Sandi\'s blog and heard her playlist which she has on the right side (same as I do) and wondered why I could hear her blog and not mine. So I started researching. The first thing I did was email Terry to see if he had any advice. He took a look, with 4 different browsers no less, and had no problems with my blog so he suggested I clear the cache. That\'s Blogger\'s usual advice too so I tried it but it didn\'t help. Then I got a clever idea. Why not try disabling a,\'-ons to see if any of them were the problem. Wow, what I discovered would make almost 2 posts. First off I had way too many Java Consoles installed. Apparently when you update Java it doesn\'t overwrite the old console but just a,\'s a new one on. I\'m down to just the latest Java Console and the Java Quick Start a,\'-on. That works fine so no problem there. Then I disabled everything else and restarted the browser. My blog showed fully and the playlist I\'d been missing played beautifully. So I started enabling a,\'-ons one at a time and found the culprit. It was Ad Block Plus. That\'s a sweet a,\'-on and I\'m going to miss it because I hate ads being stuck willy nilly all over the pages I\'m viewing and this baby took care of that. But lately it seems to be messing with Java and Flash content so I guess I\'m better off without. Then I googled \'Firefox a,\'-ons that cause problems with blogger\' and got this fantastic page by Mozilla. It lists the extensions that cause problems, what they mess up, and gives a workaround. How helpful of them to put that up. It was even dated as recent as December 10, 2009 so it\'s very current. Yes, Adblock and Adblock Plus were on the list. It also told me why my browser sometimes gave a message of Firefox is still running when I\'d shut it down and then tried to restart it. That little snafu was thanks to Cooliris which is another neat a,\'-on but I can do without too. So that\'s gone now too. Now my a,\'-on list is much pared down and I\'m happy with the way the browser is working again. I hope that link helps if you are having any problems with Firefox. Peace! Hope! &amp; Joy! It\'s raining this morning, and in a,\'ition to the loving behavior of my younger cat Hooboo making bread on my shoulder before settling down on top of me to await my arousal, I woke to thinking about blogging. It\'s been more than a month since I wrote anything and I apologize to all of you who\'ve been checking in from time to time. I titled this the \'Season of Bloglessness\' because I\'m not the only one who hasn\'t been blogging lately. My friend Susan just posted after an absence of over two weeks and my good friend Sandi has been absent from blog land for almost as long. I\'ll let you read Susan\'s blog to find out what she\'s been up to. Sandi on the other hand is very busy with a no longer empty nest. Her son Wallace has moved back in. I\'ll let Sandi tell you the story but you need to know that her life is doing all kinds of adjusting right now, so if you read her blog please take the time to drop by and give her support. I know she means to get back to blogging sometime soon but her computer is in what is now Wallace\'s bedroom. My job is going well. I love what I\'m doing and the people I\'m working with. Thank you for being so faithful. I\'ll try to write again soon with pictures of the Christmas Poinsettias I was gifted with. Blessings for now. Life got rather busy a few weeks ago. I mentioned in an earlier post that the Census had called and asked me to work for them again. The job kept getting postponed for a couple of weeks and that frustrated me some at the time. But the work finally started and it is still as much fun as it was earlier this year. The slow spell of the summer is over and we are gearing up to hire a lot of folk for the upcoming census taking. If you want a temporary job that pays fairly well and helps your government put resources where they are needed most then click here . One of the nice things I like about this job is there is so much to learn about the project. I\'m a perpetual student and excel in learning environments. This one has a lot to teach me. The fact that we do a Census every 10 years is dictated by law. I believe it\'s written into the Constitution. There is a deadline for it. The Census totals need to be on President Obama\'s desk on a specific date in the mi,\'le of next December. The goal is to do a better job of counting every person in the country than they did in past decades. We are aiming for 100%! That 100 percent isn\'t just those of us who live in houses or apartments. It includes trailer parks too. That I could have figured out. But for some reason I hadn\'t figured on them counting campground dwellers, boat owners who live in them on the water, and people in care facilities like hospitals, retirement communities, and jails. And then there are the people who live in shelters, under bridges and overpasses, and in boxes. Yep, we plan on counting them too. That thought brings to mind an old black and white movie image of hoboes around a campfire. I wonder if they will search railroad cars for people. That\'s the main news on my front. I\'m busy and feeling good about it. Yay! Other news is that my list of friends on Facebook has grown. A bit of that is thanks to Classmates.com. I\'m reconnected with a few folks in my high school graduating class. That\'s kind of neat and I\'ll probably try to go to a reunion when they hold it. On a more interactive front an old college chum got in touch with me the same way. I\'d not heard from Harry in something close to 30 years but we were great friends when we attended the same college. He\'s doing well and is in town for the holidays to see his Mum. We are meeting for lunch tomorrow. I wonder what we will talk about. My Dad sent me a box full of pictures from the family collection. He is scanning them into his computer and was just going to toss them so I asked if I could have them instead. Yeah, I love a digital image and can look at one for hours if it\'s really good. But just like books, a real photograph printed on paper is somehow more tangible and generates strong memories and emotions. Guess I\'m just an old fashioned girl when it comes to some things. I guess the last bit of news is that tonight I\'m attending a Celtic Christmas Concert at my church. The music I\'ll hear is going to be performed by Jeff Johnson, Brian Dunning, and Wendy Goodwin. I hope to come away with a CD or two of their music. If you want to listen to some clips of their stuff the website is here . I\'ll try to write about the concert and my impressions later this week. Peace, Hope &amp; Joy! Wednesday evening is practice night for my church choir, of which I\'ve been a member for about a year. These days we are gearing up for the annual Lessons &amp; Carols service. It\'s exciting because there are always lots of new numbers to sing and it is the choir showcase service. We are also thinking ahead to Christmas Eve service which also has lots of music in it. Our choir director asked if any of us would be interested in doing some group numbers, not exactly solos but still out front and I said count me in. So this Christmas I may be part of a trio singing a medley of carols. When choir practice was over we had a birthday celebration for anyone who\'s birthday is in November and those we\'d missed earlier in the year. This is renewing an old tradition among our group that fell into disuse and I think we are all happy to have it back again. Everybody should have their special day. The members who volunteered to sponsor this month\'s celebration brought wine, desserts, and some nice crackers, chips, and dips. It was all good. Then we left for the evening. Outside our sanctuary door there\'s a motion activated security light. It\'s dark earlier these days so I was glad that it came on as I headed out to my car. But apparently someone in the world wasn\'t so happy. As I passed the tree on the corner of the building I heard a sound I\'d never heard before. It was a sort of hooting. I stopped and listened and it happened again and again. It was an owl protesting about light disturbing his peace. In all my life I can\'t remember ever having heard an owl before, but I recognized it immediately. Perhaps there\'s no other bird that sounds like that. Maybe it\'s so distinctive that once you\'ve been told what an owl sounds like you can\'t mistake that sound for any other bird. The moment made me feel very good. To know that nature was out there and active, that a bird I tend to think of as a wilderness creature was on our church grounds, made me aware of how special our sanctuary and grounds are. Whenever I\'m on our campus I feel blessed. There\'s this feeling that just seems to fill the grounds up, not just the sanctuary. We call ourselves reconcilers and I think that sound served to remind me that we reconcile ourselves to nature too. The Happiness Project had an interesting post the other day about de-cluttering. It was rules to not follow. In it Gretchen gave Eleven Myths of De-cluttering along with how we should not follow those old beliefs and why. I was surprised to find these out and have to admit that I\'m guilty of believing and practicing many of them. Maybe I can try out these new methods and get better results. What do you think? Are you guilty of any of these? Peace! Hope! &amp; Joy!
When the Brisbane Roar had finished their practice session we decided to go over to see if we could meet some players. Geraldo was particularly interested in meeting some Brazilian players who were on the team. Most of the players had gone into the change room by the time we had walked over from the other side of the stadium but we were lucky enough to meet a couple of the Brazilian players who were talking to the coach. I told them that Geraldo was a top ranking soccer player in his hometown in Vanuatu and they were very friendly and were happy for us to take some snaps. The coach whose name was Kenny seemed very interested in Geraldo and he suggested I call his friend, David, a soccer coach at the Academy of Sport to see if he could include Geraldo in some training sessions before he went back to Vanuatu which was a week away. He said there was another Ni-Van boy who was in the training squad there. Wow we couldn\'t believe our luck! We managed to get another photo of Geraldo with a gorgeous Aussie player before we left. We drove over to Ballymore Stadium which wasn\'t too far and found out the Brisbane Roar did their soccer training at 9:30am in the morning so we all came back the next day to see them practice. Geraldo was very excited and watched them intensely. We decided that since Geraldo was such a keen soccer player that we should take him for a visit to the Suncorp Stadium where the big soccer games are played. The stadium itself was locked up but we could see into it from the stadium shop. Of course the stadiums in Vanuatu don\'t look like this! The fellas who were serving in the shop were very friendly and when we told them that Geraldo was a soccer player from Vanuatu they suggested we take him to another stadium called Ballymore where the Brisbane Roar, Brisbane\'s top soccer team, practised. On the way home on the CityCat Geraldo was in high spirits. He was really enjoying his stay with us in Brisbane! Our next excursion with Geraldo was to take him to the cinema. Geraldo had watched plenty of DVDs but had never been to a cinema before as there aren\'t any in Vanuatu. We chose to take him to a 3D screening of Avatar at South Bank which pretty much blew his mind. For the best view of Brisbane we drove Geraldo up to the Mt Cootha lookout. There are wonderful views of the city and surrounding areas. You can see as far as the Glass House Mountains to the North, the Gold Coast Hinterland to the South and Moreton and Stradbroke Islands to the East. As usual he was pretty knocked out! We actually managed to spot our house through binoculars. After our bike run we decided to take Geraldo to Kangaroo Point to check out the views. Kangaroo Point is situated on top of a cliff which is now the major rock climbing attraction for Brisbane\'s abseilers. Geraldo was pretty keen on the view. Geraldo was really overwhelmed by South Bank. He just kept saying\'Oh Man!!\'He just loved the man made swimming beach. The beach consists of a beautiful clear fresh water lagoon with views over the Brisbane River to the city. Surrounding landscape consists of white sandy beaches, bubbling creeks and shady tropical gardens. He couldn\'t believe the children\'s water playground either which I have to admit is pretty cool.
My mom came up to the city over the weekend to celebrate her birthday. The weather was gorgeous and we ended the afternoon with tea and cupcakes. Millie and I are planning a trip to Madrid and Paris later this year. I know it\'s a ways off but working at a hospital requires quite a bit of notice when I need an extended period of time off, at least according to my boss. Of course I\'m getting antsy and ready for another vacation even though I was recently abroad; must be Spring Fever, or just my constant urge to travel. This picture is from a brief trip I took to Barcelona a few years ago, the nouveau architecture was so gorgeous. At least I have several months to practice my Spanish. I think about you all the time and wish you were still here. I went to see my friend Joyce this past weekend in Palo Alto. We went to some consignment shops loaded with designer goodies and I managed to get a practically brand new Chanel bag for just over $100. While on our little thrifting spree we drove past this amazing apartment building where I had to stop and get a closer look, I felt like I was back in Paris. I\'ve been thinking about painting my living room coral or a salmon color which is what I did in my last apartment. It\'s pretty, goes well with antiques, and it\'s a soothing color. My only reservations are that I\'ve been living in my place for 7 years and hate the idea of moving everything and taking all my pictures down even though my walls are dingy and could really use some fresh paint. Maybe I\'ll decide by spring time. The fashion world will not be the same without you.
You\'re in Austin. You\'re about to see an ass load of indie bands perform out of every nook and cranny of this city. It\'s 95 degrees, then it su,\'enly hails, then it goes back to 95 degrees with a humidity index of 99%. You spot a boy who wears a smaller jean size than you and you are determined to make out with him by the end of the night. It\'s late, you\'re drunk off of Lone Stars because you only had seven breakfast tacos about twelve hours ago, and you have blisters lining the bottom of your feet. These are questions and scenarios that will arise this week during SXSW. Don\'t be unprepared! Follow my survival guide list below and you\'re sure to have a worth-while and healthy SXSW experience. 1.) The Fanny Pack - Fuck purses. Who said these ever went out of style? WHO? TELL ME! I recommend the American Apparel shiny denim fanny pack in royal blue because it\'s awe-inspiring. Look at it. LOOK AT IT! Pretty. 2 .) A Pair of Tom\'s Shoes - Never mind. These hipster staples are like having a thin layer of burlap separating you from the ground. I can\'t believe they\'re donated to a child every time a pair is sold. The next generation is going to grow up all jacked with arthritis. (-this statement is in jest...Tom\'s is a great company that does a lot of wonderful things) 3.) Cheap Brightly Colored Wayfarers - Because in a way we\'re all still stuck in 2004, aren\'t we? 4.) Cardigan - Texas weather is known to be a fickle one, so make sure to carry around a cardigan with you for night or when it spontaneously rains though the precipitation level is 0%. Also, throwing on a cardigan over any shitty ol\' outfit, will su,\'enly make you look more intelligent than you actually are. 5.) Clean Underwear - \'Cause Lord only knows what you\'re going to do with your current pair of underwear. 6.) Scrunchies - Ladies, you make fun of them, but you know you secretly love them. Who is going to hold back your hair when you\'re puking up all that free Hornito\'s in the Beauty Bar toliet? Not that DJ with the florescent bike cap. He\'s been eyeing the girl with the non-prescription horn-rimmed glasses that are over-taking her face all night. You always have a friend in the scrunchie.&nbsp; 7.) Fake Mustache - Because you don\'t want to feel left out in this city. 8.) Business Cards - Business cards legitimize you. Even if you have nothing to sell.&nbsp; 9.) Granola Bars - The nice thing about Austin is that we\'re not a bunch of assholes that bump up the price of everything while you\'re visiting. However, your eating times might be off and in order to not get wasted by 4PM, it\'s worth carrying some snacks around with you (Dear Lord. I sound like my mother). 10.) Water- Blah blah blah boring 11.) $1\'s - For when you wander off alone to the strip club near the airport during a drunken blackout. Right, Marcos? 12.) Air Mattress - Often enough couches are better than air mattresses. Most of the time you wake on the hard wood floor, the mattress having deflated like that of your hard-on after popping way too many A,\'erall. However, the couch might already be taken by the time you get there, so make sure you come prepared.&nbsp; 13.) Chapstic k - Because by the end of the night, your mouth is going to look like that of a crusty crack a,\'ict. 14.) Condoms 15.) Diana Camera - To commemorate the night you get shit-faced with Bill Murray or corner David Byrne up against a wall and explain to him how you two were always meant to be together...in lo-fi. Not that long ago, I received an email from an Austin-based musician very eloquently sharing with me the day he realized he was a hipster. His words were poignant, describing his realization as though he was su,\'enly inflicted with an incurable disease- Hipstermystalacosis. I related to his story and I think you will too. When I was thirteen and running around in suspenders and non-prescription eyeglasses, I knew there was a name for me. For years I fought the label, but gave up my denial of being a hipster when I christened the name of my blog Hipstercrite. Now when someone calls me a hipster, I shake my head in agreement. I am a hipster and probably always will be. Hipsters, stand up tall! Unite! Dear Lauren, I\'ve been an admirer of your page for a few months. I was linked through\'TapeBombs,\'a music blog run by an acquaintance of mine. Like you, I am dangerously preoccupied with hipsterism and spend a good deal of my day confronting the issue. The reason I am mailing is because I think I represent an interesting case study: a person caught in the paralyzing fear of his latent hipsterism and shocked into his true identity by a harrowing event. Here is my account: I was riding my bike down Duval and the sun was out. At this point I believed firmly in my individuality. Of course, my handlebar wrap matched my brake housing, and the same with the metal cages that held my water bottles; all were red. I wore purple shoes and no helmet. The memory of a triumphant sexual encounter arose quickly, then left. I was pleased with my performance and didn\'t dwell on the details, didn\'t analyze a thing. I only recalled the sensations and sounds that make good sex memorable. The day was warm. Readjusting my fingers on bar, I found them to be quite cool; I hadn\'t begun to sweat. The best part of the ride. In the first few seconds of what would be the minute and a half that changed my life, I didn\'t recognize the origin of the rumble, growing closer, rapidly becoming a roar, like the slow onset of a far off thunderclap. The sound came from the twin tail pipes of a Chevy Diesel truck. Su,\'enly, they were upon me. As I turned down a steep hill near 51st and Lamar, I was forced against the curb. The huge wheels of the truck kicked up dust and rocks and I was struck by a few of them. A large white male leaned out of the passenger window, ejecting a thimble-full of spit across the front of my shirt. A beer bottle whizzed over my head. I felt like a frightened Russian Hussar riding against Napoleon, holding out my hand as if to protect myself from the zip of bullets and the whistle of passing artillery. At this point, about a foot separated my handle-bars and the side of the truck. After a few more terrifying seconds, the truck sped up quickly, finishing the descent and pulling into a parking lot at the bottom of the hill. I knew what they had in mind. But remember, I was not some pussy hipster. I was not androgynous. I was a man. That archaic sense of honor strengthened me. Four men stepped out (the type of men who buy their groceries at the county feed store). They came at me from thirty yards away, not running, but at a kind of a trot, like this was a leisure activity. I lept off of my bike and approached them in the mi,\'le of the lot. I put my dukes up, lithely shifting from side to side with the assured stance of an experienced boxer. I think they sensed my confidence, baseless as it was. They stopped about ten feet away. I held my ground. Each wore what looked to be an Ed Hardy tee. Only I didn\'t sense the danger then. I was like a cornered puma, fiercer because death clears away the vale of fear. Underneath the decorated tees, the four mens limbs were taut and ready. One word, one altered expression would have uncapped that explosive energy. But there was silence. The crack of bat, followed by childrens laughter, echoed from the top of the hill. We measured one another. It was the leader who broke the silence. His followers relaxed. The engagement was apparently broken off, or at least postponed for a moment. He sai,\'dFuck you, limp dicked hipster.\'His friends didn\'t laugh, but chimed in.\'Pussy! Hipster! Faggot!\'I didn\'t reply. I had relaxed my stance. The passenger side agitator spat at me again, but missed. Twenty seconds later the truck was gone and I was left alone in the bright sun. My world view was completely fucking shattered. What passed through my mind as I gingerly pedaled home was not so much the glorious afterglow of a manly confrontation, but the providential nature of my lot in life. I knew that, so far as the outside world was concerned, I was a hipster. Whatever innate qualities I possessed were in dichotomous opposition to a certain portion of society, whose hatred of my\'type\'acted as a form of self-actualization. This tension was absolutely necessary, and in a larger sense, determined my ultimate role in history. I still have not recovered, not fully. Now, when I listen to my own music, songs like\'Don\'t Try and Take My Guns,\'Burning Panties,\'and\'You Should Start A Ban,\'dI do not hear the voice of myself, but someone who struggles to hide the mark of an old wound. And while I am ashamed and at times it all seems clownish and sad, I remember that this is what makes good art - that is, fear and its poignant beauty, like a shivering mouse you\'ve caught in a beam of light. My story is that of the reluctant hipster. In your wor,\'dpretending we\'re not hipsters is what we do best.\'In this way, I am surely the most resourceful of hipsters. But, unlike so many others, it has enriched my art and given me a new purpose; or more nearly, an enhanced clarity of vision. Sincerely, Marshall Galactic of The Frontier Brothers Marshall Galatic is from the Austin-based band The Frontier Brothers .

Stopped at a traffic light last Friday afternoon, I glanced up at a familiar restaurant marquee that usually carried a quip relating to the latest music festival/bike rally/music rally/bike festival in Austin that week. However, this time the words bore a different sentiment:\'Go Texas! Win it for Leslie !\'The light turned green and I found myself driving south down Congress Avenue with tears pooling at the bottom of my eyelids. Every Austinite knows who Leslie is. He is the city mascot. The epitome of what makes Austin unique. For those who do not know him, Leslie Cochran is a homeless man who wears a leopard print thong. He has run for city mayor multiple times and has been reviewed 53 times on Yelp . He is an extremely articulate and sweet-natured man. No one has a bad thing to say about Leslie. Which is why it\'s so surprising that unnamed assailants beat Leslie to unconsciousness two weeks ago. Leslie was in bad shape and listed in critical condition. The townspeople formed a vigil and the local news gave daily updates on his health. It was looking like Leslie was not going to make it, but miraculously he pulled through and was released from the hospital last week. He has since thanked the locals for their support, stating that he would have not made it through otherwise. Though a percentage of his medical bills have been taken care of, there will be a fundraiser on November 1st to help pay the rest. By the time I read the sign last Friday, I knew that Leslie was alive and well. What made me tear up was the realization that I live in a town that cares immensely for an eccentric homeless man. It\'s also a city where that same homeless man can run for mayor multiple times and still get thousands of votes. Last month marked my one year anniversary of moving to Austin. I moved here with no road map and only what I could fit in my car. The plan was to stay a few months and then see where my A,\' took me next. However, whatever energy that made me curious enough to move here has made me stay here. I could tell after my first night in Austin that I was someplace special and I haven\'t wanted to leave since. Each day this city inspires me more and more and at moments I can honestly say that I\'m in love (that could also be because I haven\'t had a boyfriend in a long time). So in honor of this city that took me in with open arms after fleeing a tumultuous relationship with Los Angeles, I will begin using this blog for part-time Austin\'goings-on\', part-time hipstercrite musings. not sure who the owner of this picture is, but thanks Everyone ought to have a Lower East Side in their lif e- Irving Berlin The East Side has typically been synonymous with art, culture, history, and grit. When we venture through LES in NYC or Wicker Park in Chicago or Silver Lake in Los Angeles, we feel like we\'ve stepped back into time, that we\'re not necessarily welcome, and that at any moment something wonderful or terrible might happen. This also goes for Austin\'s east side. A vibrant and fascinating part of the city, Eastside boasts eclectic eateries, trendy bars, and dozens of notable art galleries all maintaining the feel of a bygone era. Chances are you\'ll be spending some time over on the Eastside during SXSW and if so, you might want to know where to eat (if you aren\'t stuffed full of free breakfast tacos supplied at the parties). Here is a list of some of the best East Austin restaurants, cafes, and bars: Best Pizz a: East Side Pies 1401 Rosewood Ave. Many will say that Homeslice on SoCo is the best pizza in Austin, but they\'re embarrassingly wrong. East Side Pies is hands down the best and most imaginative pizza around. Try their Veggie Nacho pizza topped with spicy black bean sauce, onion, tomatoes, jalapenos, and avocados. Or their Blue Moon which is a tomato-less pizza topped with feta, mozzarella, ricotta, goat, romano , and blue cheeses. They also supply delicious salads, blondie brownies, and bottled sodas. The staff is awesomely sassy and the place is a little small and very busy, so make sure you don\'t dilly-dally. Price: Cheese slice $2.50/Meat or veggie slice $3.00 Best Vegan/Vegetarian: Mr. Natural 1901 E. Cesar Chavez One of two Mr. Natural locations in Austin, this restaurant is conveniently located in the heart of the east side. Both a restaurant and a health food store, Mr. Natural supplies an assortment of food options ranging from a vegan/vegetarian lunch and dinner bar that changes daily to delicious baked goods to cakes to homemade juices. Absolutely worth trying is the Soya Guisada on Fridays and the vegan mint chocolate cupcake. You will never think of veganism the same way again. Price: Lunch buffet $7.99, pastries range from .75-$3.50 Best Mexican : Juan in a Million 2300 E. Cesar Chavez This was a hard category to decide in. I like a lot of Mexican food on the Eastside : Aranda\'s simplicity, El Chile\'s creativity, and all the taco trailers in between. I chose Juan in a Million because it\'s the most famous Mexican food restaurant on the Eastside , having been featured on the Travel Channel\'s Man vs. Food and Countdown Chowdown . Juan in a Million is most famous for their\'Don Juan\', a potato, bacon, egg, and cheese scramble that, which I believe, has been cooked on the same gri,\'le for over twenty years. It\'s also $3.60 and could last you two days! The atmosphere is quaint, but make sure to go at off times. Especially on the weekend, lines can form down the sidewalk! Price: The Don Juan $3.60 Best Sandwich: Bossa Nova 2121 E. 6 th St. Located across the street from the Lance Armstrong Foundation, this Brazilian eatery has some of the best food on the east side. Don\'t let the fact that it\'s Brazilian scare you away- their menu is plentiful and delicious while still being unique. My favorite sandwich (when I eat meat) is the Misto Tudo which has turkey, ham, sliced egg, green olives, palm, and mozzarella. Or the Salada de Maca with romaine, apples, cranberries, walnuts, blue cheese, and balsamic dressing. Price: Lunch Special- any 1/2 sandwich or pizza slice with a side salad or soup $6.99 Best Coffee : Texas Coffee Trader s 1400 E. 4 th St. Texas Coffee Traders is quite possible my favorite place to visit on the Eastside . Often overlooked due to the fact that it\'s housed in a warehouse, this place is not to be missed. A Disneyland for the coffee connoisseur, Texas Coffee Traders has rows and rows of unique coffee to taste and buy. Typically a place to get your coffee in bulk, the friendly staff will fix you up a cup of cappuccino or tea while you wait. However, this year for SXSW, the store will be setting up a coffee stand on the corner of 4th and Navasota, so make sure to check them out! These guys will remind you of why you love Austin. Most Romantic: Justine\'s 4710 E. 5 th St. Justine\'s is relatively new to the Eastside , but a wonderful a,\'ition. Situated in an old house, the ambiance of Justine\'s is quaint and warm. One enters below a vintage neon sign onto a front yard draped with string lights and tables. Inside the dark wood and vaulted ceiling of the house make for a cozy atmosphere. Justine\'s is a great place to grab a drink or dine in. Inspired by French cuisine, my favorites include the Endive Poire Rouqefort Salade (endives, rouqefort , walnuts, and pear) and the Steak Tartare . Price: Endive Poire Rouqefort Salade $8.50, Steak Tartare $14 Most Metropolitan: East Side Show Room 1100 E. 6 th St. East Side Show Room is also a relatively new to the Eastside . Channeling a 1920\'s feel, the bar/restaurant showcases vintage furniture and fixtures, local art, and some of the best lighting in town. East Side Show Room is also one of the best places to see and be seen these days. The menu is a little steep, but definitely creative and delicious. Their curried grits and greens is a must, as is their Barbequed Quail and Oranges. Price: Curried Grits &amp; Greens $9, Barbequed Quail &amp; Oranges $18 Most Chill: Rio Rita 1308 E. 6 th St. Rio Rita has quickly become of of my favorite hangout spots on the Eastside . Cafe by day, lounge by night, this funky bar looks like an explosion went off in a vintage furniture store. Rio Rita serves a collection of local food, infused vodkas, and mystery beers. On Monday night you can listen to your own 45 for\'Love and a 45\'night or bring your crayons and glue for\'Arts and Drafts\'night on Thursdays. This is definitely a great place to kick back and mingle with the quirkiest of the bunch. Price: Ham &amp; Brie sandwich $6.50, Turkey &amp; Cranberry on a Croissant $6.50 Photo source: Yelp.com Do you have that one dress, one pair of hot pants, or that one hat that always compels people to stop you, grab you arm, and say in a low voice,\'Where on Earth did you get that?\'Well I just found me a pair of socks that garnered lots of comments at Whole Foods yesterday (\'cause you have to look good when you go to Whole Foods). And an awkward run-in with a security guard at Wells Fargo. The security guard was sitting on a bench, and I think she quietly sai,\'dI like your boots\'(meaning she liked my awesome kick-ass lace-up slippers) as I walked by. I didn\'t quite hear what she said, so I turned and gave a slight smile. The sort of smile that says,\'I have no idea if you were talking to me or not, but here, here is a half smile to sort of acknowledge what you said\'. I started obsessing over whether or not she was talking to me and I started to sweat. I wanted to walk up to her and say,\'Thank you!\', but the time for that had past and I started to rock back and forth in line. When I left the bank and no,\'ed to her, she stared at me stone-faced and I was convinced that she now hated me for giving her a half-ass smile in return for her very sweet compliment. So you wanna know what socks will get you compliments at Whole Foods and awkward Larry David-like situations at banks? The Lacy Lace-up Slipper Socks by Sock Theory . The best part? They\'re $7. They also come in white. Make sure to check out Sock Theory\' s broad collection of unique socks, leg warmers, arm warmers, knee-highs, and panty-hose. Definitely my new favorite online store. Here are few pics of me wearing my new lace-up\'s. I had to cut my head out because the sun was so bright yesterday, between my squinting and scrunched up mouth while squinting, I looked like what would happen if Renee Zellweger and Sloth procreated. Also, I don\'t shine my shoes. Obs. First post in my Austin, TX series for SXSW It\'s that time of year again. The time of year where you stock up on your A,\'erall or Xanax or Xantac or horse tranquilizers and set your Facebook tagged photos to private. South by Southwest Interactive and Film will be starting this Friday, with the music portion beginning next Wednesday. What does that mean for you? That means your chances of getting drunk with Bill Murrary or hooking up with a hipster from Brooklyn who is in a band with the words\'bear\',\'deer\',\'neon\',\'gold\', or\'black\'in it have just improved. If you\'re new to Austin, here is a list of traits that make our town so unique. Come and join the fun! 1.) The entire city collectively waits with bated breath for the Groupon of the day. 2.) At anytime in anyplace, your chances of hearing New Order playing on the sound system are 2 to 1. 3.) We treat music festivals like national holidays (and we really don\'t have a choice). 4.) Overhear conversations that start with, (person looking at their Iphone),\'Oh, looks like Brooklyn Vegan is following me on Twitter. Cool.\'(overhear= I said it yesterday). 5.) Facebook comments like,\'There is a little kids choir singing Flaming Lips and Wilco at my place of employment right now.\'6.) Every single person has a mustache and we have competitions once a month to see who has the best. Photo by Alison Narro 7.) A 24 hour pecan vending machine in the mi,\'le of nowhere. 8.) We eat migas for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and we can tell you exactly where in town the best migas are located. 9.) The rivers in Austin are made of beer and you can often find us knelt in the river bed, stuffing our goard like Augustus Gloop in Willy Wonka. 10.) We quietly judge each other on the make of our bicycles and nothing else. 11.) The older and more worn your clothing is, the more street cred you have. 12.) We do a lot of our business out of Airstream trailers. Mostly for aesthetic purposes. The South by Southwest Festival in Austin, TX will be starting this Friday. I plan on devoting most of the week to Austin and SXSW posts. However, I haven\'t written a single thing yet! In the meantime, please enjoy this gallery of Maurizio Cattelan\'s work. I learnt of Cattelan this weekend while in Houston. The Menil Collection is currently exhibiting some of his pieces. I\'m still brewing what I think about him. What are your thoughts? You have nine followers, and one of them is your mother. You wonder why the hell you\'re even blogging. You speculate if anyone will ever read your words. You ponder if life is worth living. Well look no further! Listed below are twelve sure-fire ways to drive traffic to your blog and instantly boost your self-worth. 1.) Join Blogging Network Sites - The best blog networking website is Twenty-Something Bloggers. Hands down. Joining 20sb opened up a whole new world for me. Before then, I had no idea how to discover other blogs. 20sb is a supportive and strong community of like-minded bloggers. I can\'t recommend it enough. Other blogging networks include Blog Lovin \', Blog Her , BlogCatalog , and My Blog Log . 2.) Write Interesting Content - As much as want to go into great detail about your recent trip to the dentist or how you wrapped your Christmas gifts, refrain from it. Truthfully, nobody cares. Unless the dentist had a boner while performing your root canal or you lobbed off your finger while cutting wrapping paper for you gifts...then we might be interested. Humor is a guaranteed way to enter the hearts of millions. Take for example Hyperbole-and-a-Half . You could learn a lot from her. 3.) Write About A Trend Topic - I don\'t adhere to this rule at all, but it\'s definitely a way to create buzz on your blog. Commenting on the cultural importance of\'Jersey Shore\'or how Justin Bieber looks like he should be on the\'L Word\'is a good way to start a convo. 4.) Befriend Other Bloggers - The blogging community is a tight-knit one. I have met people that I\'m convinced sat next to me at the Algonquin Roundtable in another life. These people have encouraged me to grow as a writer and have supported and advertised my work. I wouldn\'t be where I am today without them and I try to do the same for them. As The Beatles once sai,\'dThe love you take is equal to the love you make\'. 5.) Leave Comments - Bloggers love comments like Mickey Rourke loves ghastly printed button-ups. Our self-esteem begins to slowly hinge on how many comments are left on our blog a day. If you comment on our blog, we will love you forever and most likely return the favor. 6.) Brand Yourself- The general consensus on this seems to be\'yucky\', but I disagree. The more polished the blog is, the greater the chance a reader will take it more seriously, no? Having a\'brand\'shows the world that you are legit. Does it take away from the personal aspect of blogging? Sometimes. But this is where you have to get clever in how you brand yourself. Subliminal branding. 7.) Photos! - Photos are a win-win all \'round. Photos grab attention. Photos can often work in substitute of text (Tumblr?). Photos can inspire. I try to put a picture in every single one of my posts, even if it\'s not necessary. Like a picture of my ass. 8.) Lists - We seem to really like lists. They\'re easy to read and typically very visual. Remember, the average internet reader\'s attention span is like 45 seconds (I made that up). It\'s kind of true though. Think of some of your favorite posts on Buzzfeed or EW.com . Short and sweet lists. 9.) Connect With Your Audience- One of the most talked ideas running through the marketing world these days is Lady Gaga\'s rise to fame due in part to her fan interaction and loyalty. DoDo like GaGa. Also, the blogs that appear to have the most comments are blogs where the writer shares a part of him/herself with the readers in the post, then interacts with them via the comment box. Personal is good, but don\'t forget rule #2. 10.) Self Promote, But Only 20% Of The Time - Nobody likes a showoff. However, who is going to know about your blog if you don\'t say anything? I know some very humble bloggers who haven\'t even told anyone that they have a blog! You have to walk a fine line here. Tweet or FB that you have a new post up, but don\'t send personal messages to strangers telling them to check out your blog. Nobody likes that. In fact, we\'ll purposely not go check out your blog. 11.) Believe That Your Traffic Will Go Up- I know it can get discouraging at times, but don\'t give up. People want to hear what you have to say. If you believe that your blog will be successful, it most likely will. Power of suggestion. 12.) Post a Picture of Your Ass Keep me posted on your progress! I\'m curious to hear.
Next week, I will be leaving my position with Boeing and trek to Boston to work for the MIT Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, Ma. Earlier today I read my very first blog post and how I felt my first week here at Kennedy Space Center has not changed to this day. I will definitely miss everyone I\'ve worked with, the awesome launches , and the space program! However, this does not mean I am giving up on my dream in becoming an astronaut. The blog will continue! :) I still plan on being very active in the community, stay a space advocate, and work towards a PhD. Right now, the direction of our space program is a little up in the air, but I know we\'ll get back on track. I\'m also excited that I found a nearby judo club I am going to join so I can continue the sport. This endeavor will be exciting and I will be supporting the Engineering Analysis group on various projects. Next week is my last week, but I will definitely be blogging during the move process! Thanks to all for the support up to this point. It really means a lot to me!! While attempting to load propellant Friday night, a leak was detected in Discovery\'s RCS (Reaction Control System) Helium Isolation Value   on the right-hand OMS (Orbital Maneuvering System) fuel system. Further testing and troubleshooting steps are being planned at the launch pad to examine two helium system regulators, which maintain pressure to the fuel tank and are further down the plumbing from the isolation valves. If the regulators are functioning correctly, which will be tested later this week when the necessary equipment is ready, engineers could determine Discovery can safely fly \'as-is\' despite the isolation valve problem. If a repair or replacement to the valve is required, we would not be able to access it out at the pad...which means...rolling the shuttle back to the Vehicle Assembly Building, demating Discovery from its external fuel tank and solid rocket boosters, then towing Discovery to the Orbiter Processing Facility....AND removing the OMS pod. Even with the planned testing, the April 5 launch date still stands. It\'s what comes out of these test results that will determine if we need to roll back the shuttle which would cause a delay. SpaceX successfully fired the Falcon 9 rocket\'s nine Merlin engines for 3.5 seconds, completing a key preflight test before the privately-developed booster is cleared for launch in April. Ground test was one of the final steps before launch of the Falcon 9 , which is scheduled for no earlier than April 12. The static fire verified all of the launch pad\'s ground systems are ready to support the mission. Between now and launch, engineers will install the rocket\'s flight termination system charges that would destroy the vehicle if it flew off course and threatened the public. NASA awarded SpaceX a $1.6 billion contract to fly 12 operational Falcon 9 and Dragon missions to the International Space Station beginning in 2011. SpaceX plans a flight of the Dragon in July, followed by a rendezvous demonstration with the space station in November. But those schedules hinge on a timely and successful Falcon 9 test flight in April.\'IMAX: Hubble 3D\'debuts at the Air and Space Museum...we give it the\'red carpet\'treatment - checking out the movie, checking in with the astronaut stars, listening to the star who voiced it over - Leonardo DiCaprio, and weighing in with the director and the NASA brass about the wow-factor of the IMAX experience. Also: a Falcon 9\'hot fire\'disappoints, the shuttle program manager says\'no problem\'for shuttle to keep flying, and safely -- it\'s only a question of money -- and Obama gets ready to speak up for his controversial new plan for NASA...and braces for what promises to be a firestorm of protest at planned April 15 conference on the future of America\'s space program. Discovery is currently at Launch Pad 39A. Launch of STS-131 is targeted for April 5, 2010 at 6:27 a.m. This past week, the STS-131 astronaut crew went through a mock countdown/dress rehearsal to prepare themselves for their actual launch date operations. The external tank that will be used for STS-132 (Shuttle Atlantis - targeted launch on May 14, 2010) arrived last week and was transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building. You may have heard some talk effecting Endeavour\'s planned July launch. An issue related to the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer-02 payload testing is threatening a delay to STS-134\'s slot in the manifest, to the point it may slip behind STS-133, or even as far as 2011 in a worst case scenario. However, no decision will be made on the schedule until after a,\'itional testing results and the launch of STS-131 in April. Read more.. here . The next step in ground testing SpaceX\'s Falcon 9 rocket will be a hotfire of the first stage engines. The launch team will ignite the nine Merlin 1C engines for three-and-a-half seconds during the test. Hot fire is targeted for late morning or early afternoon, tomorrow. Lift-off of the rocket could occur late this month, but more likely early April. Florida\'s Space Coast braces for layoffs, Buzz Aldrin muses on the next steps for NASA and his upcoming stint on\'Dancing with the Stars,\'plus other headlines from This Week In Space. Yesterday I attended the Space Coast\'s Society of Women Engineers Awards Banquet. I was nominated for the Distinguish New Woman Engineer award. We had guest speaker Dr. Cammy R. Abernathy (Dean, College of Engineering of University of Florida and Professor of Materials Science and Engineering) who gave a great insight about the economic shift in society that has effected the engineering disciplines within universities and industry. I was selected to receive the award in the category I was nominated for. It was a great honor accepting this award last night and being surrounded by so many women who embrace leadership and give back to their community. I have had great support and encouragement from my mentors who have helped shape me professionally throughout my career. One thing I have learned for sure is that you can never have too many mentors. I learn a variety of qualities from the different people I look up to. The ceremony was fantastic and I was amazed in the technical leadership of all the nominees.

I want another baby. I really do. Yassine-not so much.But he may not have to worry-at least not if Martin Kramer has his way. The current fellow at Harvard\'s Weatherhead Center for International Affairs has suggested I -and other Palestinian women from Gaza- should deliberately be stopped from having babies because chances are, they will be grow up to be radicals.According to the Electronic Intifada, who first broke the story last week, Kramer offered this fasinating piece of solicited advice in the annual Herzliyah Conference in Israel earlier this month in which he called on \'the West\' to take measures to limit the births of Muslim Palestinians of Gaza and consider them a form of terrorism, or, as Kramer puts it, \'extreme demographic armament\'. He also praised the unconscionable Israeli siege for getting the ball rolling already and reducing the numbers of Palestinian babies there (see: infanticide; Gaza Diet). If your skin didn\'t curl watching the audience clap at the end of that video, well, save your soul somehow.Family Planning, the Martin Kramer way Kramer\'s argument: Gaza is a cauldron of crazy;
You may have heard the announcement yesterday, via WWD , that Madonna and Dolce &amp; Gabbana , after a very successful pairing for their 2010 advertising campaign , have collaborated on a new line of eyewear called MDG, featuring six designs (shown above).

I can\'t seem to get enough of the very talented Diem Chau \'s unusual work. While her porcelain work is amazing, it\'s her carved crayola crayons that continue to blow me away. I have blogged about her carved crayons in the past , but recently she tackled the 12 signs of the Chinese Zodiac which are now on exhibit at the Packer Schopf Gallery in Chicago along with many of her ceramic works in a show named Sojourn. First, the 12 symbols of the Chinese Zodiac: Now, Diem Chau\'s Zodiac Crayons: She began with the monkey on the far right (note how she wrote on the crayons which was to become which animal): and once they were finished, she mounted each carved crayon on a wood pedestal for exhibition: above: all twelve Chinese Zodiac crayons, finished and mounted.

Take a look. above background photo by yang yi Below is the article by Conor Risch for PDN, followed by images from each of the 30 photographers and links to their personal sites. Look at the photographers in this year\'s PDN\'s 30 class and you\'ll find a solid refutation of the idea that \'everyone is a photographer now.\' Did \'everyone\' move to Beijing to freelance for the AP with no financial guarantee like Danfung Dennis? Or live out of a mini-van so they could create a major project like Scott Conarroe? Or defy social norms to become one of the only female photojournalists from Gaza like Eman Mohammed? Is \'everyone\' willing to be as patient as Alex Prager, who put on her own shows when gallerists ignored her? Does \'everyone\' have 2,250 followers on Flickr like Ben Roberts? Perseverance and determination are common to all these photographers but equally notable is the individuality of their interests and styles. These photographers have produced long-term projects on music scenes (Lauren Dukoff), orthodox Hasidic communities (ClÈmence De Limburg), and a mother\'s paranoid schizophrenia (Sohrab Hura). They have used the visual language of gritty reportage to shoot cookbooks (Gabriel Stabile) and created photojournalism based on \'a sense of feeling\' (Andy Spyra). They have used modern image-making techniques to lament the destruction of a centuries-old city (Yang Yi). They tell stories that matter to them in ways that make them matter to viewers. Yes, it\'s true: a lot more people are taking pictures now than when PDN was founded 30 years ago. But only a very small percentage of those people are photographers. We salute these 30 individuals, who are helping to define what being a photographer means today. óConor Risch Click on each artist\'s name below (shown in alphabetical order) to visit their website or portfolio. levi brown: alejandro cartagena: scott conarroe: sumit dayal: clemence de limburg: gratiane de moustier: danfung dennis: lauren dukoff: matt eich: matthieu gafsou: marcelo gomes: deborah hamon: estelle hanania: ben hoffmann: sohrab hura: wayne lawrence: brent lewin: eman mohammed: adrian mueller: nick onken: alex prager: thomas prior: ben roberts: anna skladmann: andy sprya: gabriele stabile: peter van agtmael: elizabeth weinberg: yang yi: reed young: You can view more pieces from each of these 30 photographers at PDN\'s online gallery here.

From bacon to blueberries, pretzels to pecans, you can be as adventurous or as safe as you\'d like. I made three to test them out (shown below). One was dark chocolate with real orange bits and orange chocolate drops, another was milk chocolate, pecans and toffee and the third was milk chocolate with organic salted pretzels and caramel chocolate drops. And yes, they are, er.... were, delicious. So, how do you do it? You start with your choice of milk, white or dark chocolate as the base: Then you are walked through the process to choose as many or as few a,\'itives as you wish from the following options (click on each image below to enlarge): Choose your fruit: Your spices: Your nuts: Your confections: Your decor: Your grains: There\'s no minimum.

Filled with edgy and artful photography by such well-known photographers as Terry Richardson, Mario Testino, Josh Olins, David Sims, S¯lve Sundsb¯, Juergen Teller, Angelo Pannetta and of course, Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott, the magazine is light on editorial and heavy on nude models. For their third issue, they featured 8 different covers of nude supermodels Lara Stone, Jeneil Williams, Amber Valletta, Naomi Campbell, Kristen McMenemy, Daria Werbowry, Natalia Vodianova and Kate Moss with strategically placed censor bars. The magazine also includes editorial shots of the same models baring all. above: Kristen McMenamy from the interior editorial in the magazine Shot by talented and respected fashion photographers Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott , and styled by Katie Grand, the magazine\'s 3rd issue and its 8 covers were very hyped. The Gap (UK) even proposed a limited edition Tee of each of the 8 covers: The T-shirts went on sale now at Dover Street Market in London and Colette in Paris, priced £30 and quickly sold out. All profits from the GAP LOVE tee shirts went to support Haiti. The one exception was Kate Moss\' tee, whose profits went to Great Ormond Street, a UK children\'s charity. All 8 covers are shown below, along with a few of the very risquÈ, but stunning editorial shots. As artful as they are, this makes this post inappropriate for those under 18.

This isn\'t just a trend, it\'s a new social norm that both women and men are obviously embracing. Women are gravitating to younger men because they seem to have more of an energetic spirit that matches theirs. Women are taking better care of themselves, as a result, 40 is the new 30; 50 is the new 40. So the age difference becomes a non-issue.

For those of you joining us for the first time, please go back and start reading from the beginning (back in August 2005). Otherwise, the blog may not make much sense to you. 2009 UPDATE: This blog authors are using the assistance of LANDOLT &amp; ASSOCIATES in Fort Worth, Texas, for advice on this blog. Please contact them if you have any questions or inquiries: contact@landoltlawoffice.com Hi, this is Traci, the Blog Administrator... The twins are trying to decide what should be posted here and what shouldn\'t. I apologize for the delay. I was reading back over the posts and some of the emails, and some of them are really interesting about twins switching places. I thought maybe we could open up a discussion about that while we wait... If you are a twin or know a twin who has switched places, please email your stories to me. We\'ll try to put together a posting with everyone\'s comments, so be sure to indicate if it\'s okay to post it on the blog. You are also welcome to send in your impression of identical twins overall...and how this blog has or hasn\'t changed your view of twins. And, of course, if you do send in your comment or email, we will send you a totally imaginary Twinkie Experiment T-shirt! Thanks to all you loyal Twinkie Fans out there! Time to go buy a box and eat some while we\'re waiting. Traci Email inquiries: contact@landoltlawoffice.com Happy New Year, Ya\'ll!! While Ashley has been portraying me down here at the coast, I was up north living in her condo. Yes, while she was on the beach and enjoying the ocean, I was\'enjoying\'the lovely white fluffy stuff. I took this picture of the view behind Ashley\'s condo. Talk about a contrast to the view outside my house! Sorry about the delay in the blog posts. Ashley and I have been having\'creative differences\'about this blog. To make a long story short, Ashley read my comment about her and Tarkington and said: I CAN\'T BELIEVE YOU TOLD THEM THAT! The way I see it, Professor Tarkington is MY professor. MINE. What happens at the law school is my business because these people think that was ME doing all that stuff. So why can\'t I talk about it? Ashley really loves all of you out there and appreciates your support. I understand that, and I think that\'s great. But, it doesn\'t mean that you should have the details glossed over or sugar-coated. I\'ll try to give you hints about Tarkington when I can--until I can figure out a way to give you the whole story... How embarrassing that Ashley and I are having a fight on the world\'s stage. This has to be my mom\'s worst nightmare... Back to what happened to me... As one of the Commentors pointed out (and made me laugh), the Twinkie Experiment wasn\'t exactly fair--at least at the beginning, because Ashley got a nude beach, and what did I get? Altitude sickness! Overall, I have to admit, I probably did have an easier time with the whole school thing. Dr. Lyle was in on the Twin Switch, so I didn\'t have to go into an academic program alone. I can\'t imagine for my life walking into a law school program like Ashley did. I feel bad about laughing, but I can\'t help it. She probably was able to do it because she has this mentality that she can handle anything. I don\'t think she knows even now what a lion\'s den she was walking into. I had the opposite problem. Instead of walking into a room full of law students who practically pee around the room to mark their territory, I had the\'huggers.\'You know who I\'m talking about. Those people who have to hug you like they haven\'t seen you in years, and you are a long-lost dear friend. I\'m not a big touchy-feely type person, unless it\'s a really hot guy who\'s doing the touching and feeling (haha). It\'s probably inherent to the whole psychology thing to have them be so tactile. Probably something Freudian. As I mentioned in an earlier post, the party Dr. Lyle had at the start of the semester was especially humorous because Ashley didn\'t give me a physical description of Robert. (She told me she didn\'t think I\'d run into him.) So the problem ended up being: How do you stay away from someone when you don\'t know what they look like? One of these days, I\'m going to ask Robert if I actually spoke to him at the party before I knew who he was... Have I mentioned that Dr. Lyle\'s husband is hot? He is. Totally. Of course, he\'s a little old and MARRIED, but I thought he was really nice looking in a Kevin Costner kind of way. (Man, I might as well delete this paragraph now, because I\'m sure Ashley will have a fit that I said that!) He was also really sweet and funny. He walked around helping the caterers and stuff at the party, and every time he\'d see me, he\'d say,\'So, are you caught yet?\'Dr. Lyle\'s husband is a psychologist, too. Can you imagine what their kids must be like???? The first day of school was pretty anxiety-driven. The lack of humidity in the air made my hair have more body ---something I\'m definitely not used to since I\'ve been living at the beach. We\'re talking flat-head city. I have a flippy haircut that is (I think) darling, and the multi-layers and flips make it look not so flat in the humidity. But when you take me from a place with 95 percent humidity and drop me into a place with 18 percent humidity, well, you can imagine what happened. The flippiness with a small\'f\'turned into flippiness with a big fat\'F\'. And Ashley is not a flippy kind of person. She warned me the people up north may not take kindly to a flippy haircut on her. I tried to get rid of it. Believe me, I tried. I used water on it after it was dry. I used hair spray. I curled it under.... But when I arrived on that huge campus and walked through the wind up hill (both ways), the hair took on a life of its own. And it decided to be flippy. And I think I told you last time, that when I ran into Paige, Ashley\'s best friend (who I\'ve met a few times when I\'ve visited Ashley in the past) the very first thing out of her mouth was WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH YOUR HAIR??? Not\'Hi, how are you,\'or\'how was your summer\', but a rude announcement that might as well have sai,\'dHey! Everyone! Look over here at this ugly hair!\'It\'s no secret that I am not a big fan of Paige. As this blog goes on, I think you\'ll understand why. The hair thing started it, though. So much for integrating quietly into the crowd. Everyone had to notice me and my hair. Which only brought on more hugging, since that\'s what psych students do. What a big difference class was compared to law school. The psych seminar actually had donuts and coffee for the students! And the first day was spent going around the room introducing ourselves. Students actually talked amongst themselves WHILE Dr. Lyle was talking. And she didn\'t kill them. Not to mention how nice everyone was to each other. We also didn\'t have to read for the first day, which was weird. Some people didn\'t even have their textbooks yet. I was in shock. The most fun on the first day was finally seeing who the notorious Robert was. He wasn\'t anything like I had imagined him from Ashley\'s comments. And I don\'t remember seeing him at Dr. Lyle\'s party. He\'s tall -- almost 6 feet, slim, but not skinny or fat. Dresses pretty nice. Dark hair and dark warm eyes with wire-rim glasses. I usually don\'t like guys with glasses, but he was an exception. Okay, I admit it, I thought Robert was cute from the very first day. But it\'s not like I hit on him or anything. I intended to keep my distance and not even speak to him. He sat in the row in front of us, and Paige leaned over to me and sai,\'dI guess he wants to make sure you\'ve seen him.\'And in typical Paige-fashion, she said it loudly enough for him to hear. The girl sitting on the other side of me, who I called\'The Screamer\'for awhile since I didn\'t know her name, of course had to say hi to Robert. She was like leaning forward with her desk (they are the individual desks, not like the rows of tables in law school), in front of me to ask Robert how his summer was. When he turned around, he just kind of looked at me for a second and then sai,\'dFine.\'Real big conversationalist. The first day of class left me with one major question: WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO PSYCHOLOGY?? I took a few courses in college, and I\'ve read stuff through the years. But somehow, they changed it. It\'s no longer the common sense intuitive, get in touch with your inner-child\'s feelings, bring memories to the surface, bells ringing, dogs salivating, penis envying, human behavior study that I thought it was. Dr. Lyle gave an overview lecture about the topics we would be covering in the course, and I was really amazed. It\'s now a complicated mixture of theories, statistics, philosophies, medicine, and science. I guess it was pretty arrogant of me to walk in there thinking I was up to par with the other students. Boy, did I learn that lesson the hard way... Here\'s a picture of what Christmas time looks like on the coast. Ashley took this picture from the upper deck of the Ferry on her way back home from law school on her last day as\'Amy.\'This is Traci, the blog administrator, and I have a message for you from the whole gang. Apparently, almost everyone (except the professors?) knows about this blog now. ( Talk about pressure...;)) We Wish You,Your Family, and Friends...A Very Merry Christmas &amp; Happy New Year!! from Ashley &amp; Amy Traci Drs. Miriam and William Lyle Joyce (Mom) Martin (Dad) Robert Peevy Paige Fowler Charlie and his flock: Rose Ricky Haylie Giny Billy Emma Lee Duane Libby Sammy Regan &amp; Booger Welcome to the Real-Life Twinkie Experiment Part Two! I\'m Amy Morrighan, and my twin sister\'s name is Ashley--who most of you already know. Just a brief background in case you are just joining us... Ashley and I are twenty-seven year old identical twins. Ashley is in her third year of graduate school, working towards her Doctorate in Psychology. Her emphasis is on Twin Studies at the University of ______. (I still can\'t put the name of her school.) She lives up North where it snows more than I would like, but otherwise it\'s beautiful. Ashley\'s best friend is named Paige. Ashley used to like a guy named Robert until the great AC/DC Concert Incident last summer. Robert and Paige are also psych doctoral students. Although Paige is more into Abnorrmal Psychology...which is understandable if you\'ve ever met her. Sorry, that was petty. Bad Amy, bad. While Ashley is in grad school, I am in my second year (a\'2L\') in law school. I can\'t give my exact location, but I can tell you I live on the coast. My interest in law has primarily been in the area of Intellectual Property. But I also am interested in other areas which span across the board. They say the first year of law school is the worst, and mine was no exception. In fact, I can honestly say, last year was the worst year I\'ve ever had. The coursework itself is challenging, but not as hard as they make it out to be. It wasn\'t the work itself I found challenging since I actually like studying the law. The people in my life you\'ve probably heard the most about are my professors for this past semester who Ashley encountered: Professor Rogerson, Professor Tarkington, and Professor Mathews. My two closest friends (or at least they were up until the Twin Switch) are Vicki and Beth. I am probably closest to my next-door neighbor, Charlie, who has taken in a whole lot of his kids and grandkids to live with him. He basically has a big ol\' heart and loves to feed and take care of people. And dogs. He has a beach house right next to mine, and actually owns mine too, though he rents it out to me. Ashley and I are the only kids in our family. Our parents live in (can I say where they live? No? Okay.) They live in a place that\'s cold, too. We have great parents who support us financially (and emotionally) while we are in school. Neither of our parents were supposed to know about the Twin Switch, but that changed when Ashley told Mom. More details about that later. We ultimately decided to do the Twin Switch for several reasons... 1. Everyone always asks us if we ever switch places, and we wanted to see if we could pull it off now that we\'re adults. 2. Ashley is working on her dissertation involving twins, and she wanted to see if her advisor would let her incorporate the data from the switch somehow. Her advisor, Dr. Lyle, said she would review Ashley\'s and my data at the end of the switch to see if there was anything workable for the dissertation. I am sure Ashley will give you the scoop on that. 3. As mentioned above, I had a hard time with law school, and was about to give up on it, and I wanted to see if there was anything Ashley could do while she was there as me. Of course, I didn\'t -exactly- tell Ashley how bad things were or how much I was relying on her for help... But that\'s because I didn\'t know how things would be for her. And she told me over and over not to say anything that would alter her behavior during the twin switch. Ashley and I also started off trying to think of a bet... I would bet we could pull off the switch (because I always knew we could), and Ashley would bet we couldn\'t. Unfortunately, we couldn\'t ever agree on what we would put for the wager. Looking back on it, I guess we could have used Robert...(Just ki,\'ing) The whole thing seemed pretty funny at first, and we both had our doubts as to if we would actually even give it a try. Then Ashley flew down to visit me, and we started getting our hair and nails done to match each other. I thought Ashley was going to catch the first flight out when I gave her a tour of the law school, showed her where everything was, where to sit, etc. I think that\'s when reality set in for her. I had no idea how freaked out she was until after the switch was over and she admitted what she did the weekend right before school started... Ashley told me I shouldn\'t mention anything about it, but I\'ll see if I can put the details in. Let\'s just say, Ashley didn\'t tell you EVERYTHING she did during the switch. I think many of you would be surprised and amused if you heard it all. As for me, you haven\'t heard everything that I went through, either. Ash and I have agreed to keep this Rated G or PG since we have no idea how old our readers are. Sorry, that means no graphic details about what went on between Ashley and Professor Tarkington (Can I mention that, Ashley? No? Okay.) You didn\'t hear that from me... I left for Ashley\'s condo up North on the weekend right before school started. Leaving the ocean was a lot harder than I thought it would be. I really felt a loss for some reason, and it wasn\'t until much later that I figured out why (with Robert\'s and Ashley\'s help). It felt like I was leaving my swingset or something. When we were little, Ashley and I had the coolest swingset in our back yard, with the monkeybars along the top, with a swing, the rings, glider, etc. It was awesome. Then, my dad took a job in another state, and we had to move. Without the swingset. Ash and I were mortified and actually grieved for our swingset. Anyway, that\'s the same grief I felt when I left the coast, and it was haunting for me. I couldn\'t understand it because I figured the Twin Switch wouldn\'t last THAT long, and I could go back anytime I wanted thanks to frequent flier miles. When the switch ended, and Ashley and I were able to sit down and go over everything, it was then Ashley told me what she had discovered regarding identity issues for twins during our twin switch. It feels like you are leaving yourself behind when you switch places with your twin. Anything that is not exactly like your twin, you have to cut off. Completely. Otherwise people who knew Ashley would never believe I was her. It\'s not just leaving my\'life\'that was hard... It was leaving ME...all the things about me that I like (fish, crabs, etc), and having to mentally train myself to like what Ashley likes or Ashley does. Mentally, it has more of an effect on you that you might think. I could never have anticipated how much it would effect me. So, I arrive up north, and (I hope I can tell you this part) I had Altitude Sickness for awhile because her condo is near the mountains. Going from sea-level to the mountains took some getting used to. I had migraine-like headaches for awhile. Other than that, escaping the 98 degree temperatures and 95% humidity was fabulous!! My hair just seemed to come alive for some reason. This, of course, meant I had to deal with the flippiness of my haircut. I have a medium length shorter-cut which is cut to flip in the back. Ashley said\'no way\'would Paige or anyone believe she would ever have a flippy cut. It was a constant battle between me and my hair there for awhile. And on my first day of class, the first words out of Paige\'s mouth when she saw me was:\'WHAT IS UP WITH YOUR HAIR?\'I met with Dr. Lyle the Saturday before school started. Ashley thinks this woman is so great, but to be honest, she didn\'t make that great of a first impression on me. She came across very\'snooty\'almost--not very friendly to me at all. Ash says it\'s because she\'s from the North and\'that\'s how some Northerners are,\'but I don\'t buy it. Everyone else was really nice. I also think Dr. Lyle had her own agenda with the twin switch. There were times when I definitely thought she purposely set me up to fail so she could see if anyone could tell I wasn\'t really Ashley. Dr. Lyle had a student reception at her house that night, which gave me a chance to be around the Psych people before classes started. Of course, Ashley didn\'t describe Robert for me, so I didn\'t know what he looked like. She told me just to ignore him anyway, since I was supposed to be her. Ashley was mad at Robert because he never called her after their one date they had (that ended in disaster). So the plan was for me to just stay away from him. I don\'t think Ashley realized that Robert was signed up to be in the same seminar as I was. It was just a matter of time before I ran into him. At Dr. Lyle\'s party, however, I tried to avoid him. But how do you avoid someone when you don\'t know what that person looks like??? There was a girl at the party named Jamie who walked over to me first thing and wanted to know how my\'date with Robert\'went. I told her I didn\'t want to talk about it, and she sai,\'dOh, that\'s because he\'s HERE, isn\'t he?\'I almost freaked out right then because for all I knew, I had already been talking to him and been sickly-sweet and nice, like I was trying to be to everyone I encountered. Later during the party, Jamie came up to me again to let me know she saw Robert in the livingroom. I tried to sneak a peek at the guys in the livingroom to see if I could guess which guy my sister would like. I didn\'t have Robert pegged right, though. I still can\'t remember if I actually talked to him or not before I knew who he was. If I did, I\'m sure he thought it was weird, because on Monday, when I really did find out who he was, I intentionally stayed away from him. Well, I wanted to give ya\'ll some background on me and to kind of let you know where things started. This has been just some general comments, and next I\'ll try to get into the details more. Hi Everybody~! I took this picture right out in front of Charlie\'s and Amy\'s beach houses. It\'s my favorite time of day--sunset. I apologize for not posting sooner. Things have been pretty hectic, as you can probably imagine. Thanks to everyone for your kind emails to Traci that she forwarded to me. It has meant a great deal. As I think Traci posted already, Amy would like to have a chance to give her side of the\'story.\'She read my blog postings, which is okay, since I was trying to get her to switch back and told her where the site was so she could know what\'s been going on in her life. She isn\'t actually mad or anything; she just wants people to see how things were for her before they judge her. I told her no one is judging anybody. Life is life, and we\'re all human. Let he who is without sin cast the first stone, so to speak. I hope you all will enjoy Amy\'s side of things. She was going to post her own blog all along, but she wasn\'t sure who she could trust to get things out there without getting caught. We had some close calls, and given her background at the law school, she had to be extra extra careful. She did keep a journal though with entries, so she can make postings rather than throw it all out there all at once. I\'m not sure what format she is going to use, though. I think it also depends on Traci. I suspect it will be a little at a time. I told Amy she should try and publish the information in a book somehow since the information is already writen, instead of re-writing it as a blog. Plus, there are some details both of us experienced that we didn\'t (and still don\'t) feel comfortable putting on the computer (I think you guys might like to hear some of that stuff as well--cough, cough). So this will give Amy a chance to give you a preview of what a book might say--only the Rated G (PG?) blog version. I know from my experience that it\'s really easy to form opinions about someone by watching someone else living their life. So, all I ask is that you not be too hard on me (or her) as you hear what Amy has been up to in my life. :o) Thanks again for your friendship and support during the past months. God Bless you, Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, Ashley Morrighan Hi, this is Traci again. I know everyone is waiting to hear what happened with the Twin Swtich -- I have been waiting too, very impatiently. I finally heard from Ashley, and thankfully she and Amy have patched things up. Or, at least they are speaking to one another. Amy apparently discovered and read over this blog and was pretty ticked off... which I think we can all understand. She is now demanding equal time to give her side of what happened. And she wants it before Ashley tells everyone how things ended up with the Robert situation and the Twin Swtich. Ashley asked me this morning if I would mind posting some blog entries from Amy. I don\'t mind doing it, but I wanted to run it by our audience out there first. I\'ve gotten numerous emails from people over the past 4 or 5 months begging me for information about Amy. It looks like you\'ll finally find out what happened. Just let me know if it is something you\'re still interested in. Please just post your opinion on the\'Comments.\'And I guess we\'ll take it from there. Thanks, Traci Campbell, Blog Administrator Hi, This is Traci, the Blog Administrator. Ashley asked me to post this message for her. We apologize for the silence on the blog lately (part of it was my fault because I went out of town for two weeks). Ashley is still trying to get things straightened out with Amy. Amy still is trying to tell Robert SHE is Ashley, and neither Amy nor Robert will talk to Ashley, Ashley\'s mom, or dad. Law school for the semester is winding down. Ashley, even though she\'s ticked off at Amy, doesn\'t want Amy to lose her legal education and chance at becoming a lawyer. So, she tried to drop the classes for the semester--saying she needed a leave of absence for family reasons. The dean said no (he sounds like a MAJOR jerk to me) about Business Associations and Criminal Procedure, since those classes are required. She can, and did, drop the Intellectual Property class. She also quit being Tarkington\'s Research Assistant\'due to family reasons\'that are taking up her time. Tarkington apparently was more understanding than the dean... Which is good, considering Ashley doesn\'t know squat about legal writing. So where everything stands right now... Ashley has no choice but to try and take the final exams for Business Associations and Criminal Procedure. We all know it\'s a long shot...Talk about pressure! Richard, the guy who worked in the Law Clinic, is helping her study, by the way. Whether or not Ashley can pass the exams...I guess we\'ll have to wait and see. But that is where she is and what is going on right now. I\'m sure you\'ll hear from Ashley once the exams are over. Keep your fingers crossed for her... Traci Campbell Things have been kind of hectic, and I apologize to everyone for not posting sooner! Here\'s the basic scoop on what\'s been going on... 1. Rogerson seems to have backed off for right now... Our Operation HERB actually seems to have worked! Yea!! 2. Amy and Robert have apparently gotten serious. Like way serious. Boooo! 3. Exams at the law school start in just a few WEEKS from now... Major Booooo! 4. And, here\'s the biggest thing of all...AMY IS REFUSING TO SWITCH BACK! Monsterous Booooo! Amy says she\'s worried about what Robert is going to say if she tells him we switched places, so she\'s continuing to let him think she\'s ME. I tried to call her, and she won\'t talk to me about it. I\'ve sent emails, and she won\'t respond. I\'ve been frazzled about this situation, because at first, I thought Amy was joking. How can she not come back here? I thought the snow and cold would have sent her back here faster than anything, but I guess Robert is keeping her warm...? I also am having a cow about Amy abandoning her law school. I understand that things were bad with Rogerson--believe me, I understand! But this is ridiculous. We need to come up with a plan, and the plan can\'t involve the idea of ME taking her exams. No matter what she says, I can\'t think of a worse nightmare than Law Exams.... I\'m flying up tonight to visit my parents for Thanksgiving. The only thing I can think to do is explain everything to my parents and see if they can talk some sense into Amy. No, Amy won\'t be there. She\'s having Thanksgiving with Robert\'s family... I\'ll fill you in on other stuff going on (like with Mick and the research thing) as soon as I can.

Whether it was when I was growing up or with my own family, we have always had a dog. A dog  was an integral part of my life, until now. I am dogless. And I miss it.In my growing up family, we had a dog named Spot. Original, yes? Spot was a mutt but she was attractive enough to get a thoroughbred Boston Bull Terrier as her mate and had thirteen little ones that looked just like him. But what I remember most was my mom feeding that dog like you wouldn\'t believe. I can still see her filling up her dish with everything she could find, piled high and mumbling in Swedish under her breath about the poor thing having to feed all those pups. Didn\'t buy dog food in those days. At least, we didn\'t. (Remember this was during or just after the depression.) Just table scraps tho I saw Mom give her lots of her homemade bread to fill her up with leftover gravy over all.I kept one of the pups and called him Pepper. He died of distemper. You see, we didn\'t have all the shots and stuff like that in those days either. I wrote what I think was my first poem in my grief over his death.In almost 60 years of marriage, we\'ve had numerous dogs. I remember Flicka, a sort of black golden retriever looking dog who was a renegade and always running away from home. I would be teaching school at St. Edward\'s Catholic School about two blocks from our house and I would see Flicka running by. I was in my midlife years then--famous for running to the window and opening them to pant and the kids would all yell,
First Japan , now Paris. IKEA have kitted out four Parisian subway stations with their sofas and lamps for two weeks. The main point of the publicity is to demonstrate the quality and strength of IKEA products through the ë bum test \' of thousands of Parisians. There\'s more behind the campaign at the PSFK blog If you\'re going through St. Lazare, Champs-ElysÈes ClÈmenceau, Concorde, and OpÈra Metro stations, you\'ll have a comfortable rest on the platforms. Just hope that the Parisian homeless don\'t catch on to this too quickly, as IKEA may find they\'ll also be testing whether their sofas are stain resistant. There\'s a great set of pictures on Flickr by Les Favoris where you can see commuters spending more time looking at the sofas rather than actually sitting on them. Thanks to FreshPlastic for finding the IKEA links. After IKEA in Kobe, Japan put their furniture in train carriages (see above), we just need IKEA in the UK to get in on the act. It would make that wait for your delayed London Underground train, much more bearable. It\'s only one step on from the current round of Homebase TV ads where a station in Carlisle is decorated! Come on IKEA, London awaits. London Underground\'s former managing Director has had preliminary discussions with Tube Lines about possibly becoming the contractor\'s chief exec. This could be interesting as O\'Toole strongly criticised Tube Lines while he was in office. Perhaps it needs someone like him to help the current acrimonious disputes between LU & Tube Lines . Tube Lines hasn\'t had a permanent chief executive since February 12, when Dean Finch resigned & became chief executive of National Express. Tube Lines, which works on the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines, has been the sole surviving contractor since July 2007 when Metronet went into administration. Tim O\'Toole left the London Underground in April last year and returned to Philadelphia to spend more time with his family. David Begg, Tube Lines\' chairman, says he had the highest regard for Tim O\'Toole\'s reputation. But a,\'ed:\'I haven\'t offered Tim O\'Toole a contract, so I cannot say whether or not Tim O\'Toole is coming .\'However according to the Evening Standard a Tube Lines spokeswoman said:\'I can confirm that we are in contractual negotiations with Tim O\'Toole over the chief executive\'s job. We are hoping to conclude these discussions soon .\'The FT said that Boris Johnson declined to comment, although they believe that Tim O\'Toole has also held discussions with him. A number of people were lucky enough to bag tickets to a walking tour of the world\'s first tunnel under a navigable river. Victorians last walked through the tunnel in 1865 & now, 145 years later it was opened to the public for two days. The tickets sold out incredibly quickly, but luckily for us a number of people have blogged & very kindly shared photography. Matthew Knight aka webponce has an amazing set of pictures from the Thames Tunnel Tour . I love the detail of the original brickwork on the archways below. He said\'I\'ve always wanted to walk down a Tube line, and to be able to walk along the Marc Brunel Thames Tunnel was even more special - as the world\'s first underwater tunnel. Much of the original tunnel is still visible at the Rotherhithe end. It is amazing to think there were stalls and shops down here. Thanks to the guides who showed us around. The Thames Tunnel is an underwater tunnel, built beneath the River Thames in London, United Kingdom connecting Rotherhithe and Wapping. It measures 35 feet (11 m) wide by 20 feet (6 m) high and is 1,300 feet (396 m) long, running at a depth of 75 feet (23 m) below the river\'s surface (measured at high tide) .\'Peter Watts was also on the tour this morning\'along with every other transport nerd\'. He said:\'the tunnel reopened as a foot tunnel for what we were assured will be the very last time in its history, which is just the sort of hyperbole I like to hear on a Friday morning.... The tunnel is now pretty much indistinguishable from any other underground line. The only sense you get that you are heading under the river is that it is rather damp and chilly. Although most of the tunnel\'s original brickwork has been concreted over, there are some areas where you can still the original bricks, beautiful but damaged.\'Darryl Chamberlain from 853 blog also went along and said\'The brickwork had concrete applied to it in the 1990s to protect the tunnel   said to be the leakiest on the Underground network   but after a row broke out between London Transport and preservation agencies, a small part close to Rotherhithe station was left alone. Rather than a reminder of how the tunnel was, the existence of the exposed bri just seems to justify the decision to cover it in concrete in the first place .\'Peter continued:\'Arches bisect the tunnel throughout its length. These were originally used as small shops, as the tunnel became the world\'s first underwater shopping arcade. These spaces are tiny, and would have been cramped, dark, cold and damps places to work from. I imagine they are rather like those booth-cum-shops you get along Brixton\'s Atlantic Road, where people flog phonecards and reggae from the stairwells of blocks of flats. Here, though, you can get a sense of the detailing that distinguishes so much Victorian architecture . Peter\'s visited a number of other subterranean parts of London (deep-level Tube shelter at Chancery Lane) & you can learn about what got him initially hooked at the rest of his great blog post . Thanks to both him, Darryl Chamberlain & Matthew for sharing the experience & photos. If you managed to bag a ticket, it would be great to hear what you thought too. Remember the days when you could smile smugly in a pub quiz to answer\'What\'s unique about St John\'s Wood London Underground station?\'It\'s the only Tube station that doesn\'t share any letters with the word mackerel. A couple of week\'s ago, you might remember I asked what was unique about Pimlico Tube . Only one person worked out that it was the only station that didn\'t share any letters with the word badger! Now some clever person, Ben Green, has built a great time wasting tool\'Badgers in Pimlico\'so you can type in words and see which stations do not contain its letters. Amazingly there\'s only one station that doesn\'t have any letters of the word\'Underground\'in it (thanks to @qwghlm for that) and that Debden is unique in at least two ways (thanks to Paul Clarke & Richard George for that). Have minutes of fun seeing which other Tube stations are unique . Thanks to Fimb for the initial heads up on this! In a bid to save £16m each year, LU has announced it will be losing around 700-800 roles on the Tube. In a press release today (where the focus is on\'vision for a safe, efficient and transformed Tube\'- sad how lots of visionary releases tend to hide bad news for other people), London Underground stated there would be no compulsory redundancies and they would look to re-focus staff to areas of greater customer need. No changes will be introduced without consultation with staff and trade unions. It\'s unlikely the unions will take news of cuts lightly, so I bet the likelihood of threats of industrial action to be high. Union leaders have already told the BBC of their disappointment with Bob Crow leader of the RMT in bullish mode & dismissive of LU\'s safety reassurances:\'If these cuts to jobs are bulldozed through by Transport for London it will turn London\'s Tube stations into a muggers\' paradise .\'London Underground were clear to state that there would be no ticket office closures. It was rumoured earlier this year that 1,000 jobs would go due to ticket office losses . However the value of service provided at ticket stations, particularly in peak hours, was noted.\'The LU proposals would also ensure, therefore, that all stations with a ticket office will continue to do so, with opening hours reduced in some areas to reflect the decline in demand but remaining open at the busiest times to serve customers .\'However Gerry Doherty, general secretary of the TSSA, said Boris Johnson had betrayed staff:\'He was elected promising to keep ticket offices fully open and fully staffed.\'He has now broken that promise. We shall fight this all the way if any of our members are threatened with compulsory redundancy .\'Tube officials said the cuts would include 100 managers, 450 ticket office posts and up to 200 other jobs. Basically we have the\'huge success\'of the Oyster card to thank for the job cuts. Since its launch there has been a sharp decline in ticket sales at station offices with just one in 20 journeys paid for at the counter. iPhone users can submit refund claims for London Underground delays pretty quickly with the launch of two apps. Under the Customer Charter, if you\'re delayed by more than 15 minutes, you\'re entitled to claim the cost of your single journey on the Tube. TfL\'s website actually is fine for making a claim , but with an iPhone app, many people might be more likely to remember to do it. You can literally claim while your delay takes place. The company behind Tube Refund , one of the apps, says that there were approximately 1,996 delays across the Tube network last year (38 delays a week). Hopefully you\'re not going to get that amount personally, but the which only costs 59p, could pay for itself pretty quickly. The other app iRefund is $0.99 has fewer ratings than Tube Refund. If you have an iPhone give one a try, when you\'re next delayed. They\'ll make a useful edition to the other London Underground iPhone apps reviewed last year. Thanks to TechCrunch for the heads up on this. In the ongoing funding row with Tube Lines upgrade work, TfL are considering legal action after arbiter, Chris Bolt says London Underground has to raise £4,465m for PPP costs. In a final determination of the costs, the arbiter believes that Tube Lines\' increased estimate by £65m for the cost of the next seven and half years of work is correct. Boris Johnson & TfL are none too happy about this and with a rebel rousing yell, Boris said\'The Arbiter has ruled that the costs should be £4.46bn, thus demonstrating that Tube Lines\' breathtaking original demand for £6.8bn was simply an attempt at daylight robbery.\'Londoners will also be outraged that the Tube upgrades promised to them are now threatened.\'Simply put, we are being asked to write a blank cheque in order to prop up an ailing and failing Tube Lines, and to guarantee massive and secretive payments of £400m to its shareholders, Ferrovial and Bechtel.\'In other countries this would be called looting, here it is called the PPP .\'The fighting talk continues with\'We will fight this to the last and are seeking urgent advice on the Arbiter\'s idea to pass Tube Lines\' obligations to raise finance on to London\'s fare and taxpayers.\'We are therefore examining all our options, including legal remedies.\'Tube Lines are quietly saying that co-operation is needed\'It will be essential that it (the contract) is underpinned with a strong partnership between Tube Lines and London Underground and that both parties embrace the parameters of the agreement.\'Unlikely with talk of a legal fight & Boris\'s sparring words. Andrew Cleaves, Tube Lines\' acting chief executive, said\'It is clear that the Arbiter has relied on international benchmarking to help drive down public spending and is expecting both us and London Underground to become more efficient still by adopting some of the delivery methods used by other, more modern Metro systems around the world. This will require a step change in the way that Tube Lines and London Underground work together. We will wholeheartedly welcome working more closely with LU to simplify and modernise working practices on the Underground and give Tube passengers more, for less .\'Also earlier in the week TfL\'s interim managing director Richard Parry wrote to Bolt warning that the missing £400m would have to be found by taxpayers, in the form of higher fares, or else planned upgrade work to the Piccadilly Line would have be shelved. In today\'s press release Parry said\'The Jubilee and Northern line upgrades are seriously delayed and over budget as a result of Tube Lines\' failure to deliver, a fact now confirmed by both the PPP Arbiter and an independent QC earlier this year .\'Looks like the war of words could be moving to legal arena and in the meantime, us commuters continue to bear the brunt of the stupid PPP plan, with delays to upgrades & increased fares to fund the mess. Microsoft\'s search engine Bing kicks off its UK TV advertising tonight with a London Underground setting. Looks like the simple question of where to catch a Tube to Euston is taken to extremes - unless they\'ve been looking at the Human Body as a Tube Map diagram. Hopefully, this won\'t lead to a round of information overload for people asking for directions on the Tube. And welcome if you\'ve come here, after searching for the London Underground on Bing. You might not find what you\'re looking for, but hopefully can have fun on the way.
Today is such a beautiful day! It\'s a day to celebrate friendship, it\'s a day to celebrate life and it\'s most definitely a day to celebrate love! I\'ve always believed that love is something that we should show all throughout the year. Why wait for one special day to let the people in your life that matter know just how important they are to you? I try to make it my business to show my affection and appreciation all year long, but it is kinda fun to make that little extra effort on this one day.One of my favourite quotes is\'You know you\'re in love when you can\'t fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.\'-Dr. SeussWho knew Dr. Seuss was so thoughtful, lol, but I couldn\'t agree with him more!HAPPY VALENTINE\'S DAY everyone....it\'s gonna be a lovely day:-) I came across this song,\'Are You Listening?\'produced by Kirk Franklin. Along with a many of today\'s best gospel artists , he recorded this song to help to raise money for the people in Haiti in conjunction with UNICEF. Not only is the song absolutely beautiful, but the proceeds are obviously going to a great cause. Listen, enjoy and do your part to help if you haven\'t already done so. I remember years ago before I had a blackerry, before I knew anything about having this type of instant access to the worldwide web, to e-mails, to google
If you\'d been wondering if Draft Blogger was worth trying, any doubts should be erased right now. You need Draft Blogger to take advantage of the new template design features currently in beta. Truly, this is not something to wait for it to be released into Blogger proper. The thing is as flexible as can be. Not only are there 4 basic new templates, each with a few versions, but most of them let you change the background to one of a large variety of designs or stock photos.The fun doesn\'t end there. You can also customize the layout, and by customizing, I mean you can customize the overall layout of the blog\'s body and then pick a layout for the footer, which allows for a whole lot of variations. You can also vary the widths of the blog and the sidebars. Then you can move around your page elements/gadgets and choose colors if you don\'t like the defaults, and you have control over background colors for the page as well as for the gadgets, links, text, etc. As before, you can a,\' in any header image you want, using the header element/gadget. I would think you can also use your own background images if you upload them somewhere, ie to Picasa, by going into the html and coding it in place of the images that come with the template. I haven\'t tried that yet.
I love what Brooke had to say about the event, and also the tidbit of advice she shared of how Eunice & Sabrina\'s father would read them chapter books each night, like Treasure Island. Doesn\'t the we,\'ing look like it is out of a inviting and captivating storybook?(photos by Gia Canali &amp; Sara Remington) I popped by the Saipua website this morning, and was very inspired. Gorgeous, gorgeous. A beautiful, modern and minimally styled Norwegian Ski get away cottage --- yes, please. It is designed by architects Henriette Salvesen and Christopher Adams.(Images by Vincent Leroux from Maire Claire Maison) Oh, the sandals that are showing up all over the place -- I am loving some of the styles. Here are a few of my favorites, although they are a bit on the pricey side.1: Sam Edelman Dawson Gladiator $129.952: Antelope Maya $1323: Jeffrey Campbell Tier $724: Cynthia Vincent Odeon $250 Cameron Moll has come out with another lovely work of art. The Colosseo Letterpress Poster is now available. Isn\'t it amazing?! It is cool to watch the video clip on the site to see the process.
my handspun yarn: ma,\'er, weld, walnut, camomile In recent years spinning (with a hand spindle) is something I\'ve enjoyed during Winter evenings, but this past Winter I looked at the spindle and the wool and just did not feel motivated. Some Winters are like that for me. I get tired easily because of the lack of sunshine. Then recently I began to think again about all the wool I have stored, some dyed and some undyed, and felt inspired. So, this time around I am spinning for Spring, and so am working toward a Spring project. At the moment I\'m dyeing and spinning and then will begin to knit some kind of simple scarf-throw project. I\'ll begin the knitting on the Spring Equinox, the day I consider to be that all important \'first day of\' - so that\'s this Saturday. I\'ll knit and continue to dye wool and spin, and will work through April, hoping to complete sometime in early May. But there\'s no rush. This is a project for myself, something to enjoy in the evenings now the days feel longer. The wool used is a mix of British breeds: Shetland, Shropshire and Falklands, and some merino I have had for a while. Mostly these days if I buy wool tops to dye/spin it will be from a supplier who sells rare British breeds because I find that more interesting to use. I\'ll hope to share the project as it moves along - in simple stripes of natural colours. I am not a very adept knitter, I like to keep it simple and can\'t be asked to follow knitting pattern instructions! I\'ll be knitting the singles rather than plyed wool because I find I can spin quite balanced singles and they knit up quite pleasantly enough. I\'m dyeing the wool using mostly my tried and tested solar jar method. For dyes such as weld, I am cooking up the dried dyestuff and then straining the dye solution, pouring it into a jar to use. Some dyes, such as ma,\'er, will work well if put into the jar and covered with hot water from the kettle, but weld and alkanet for another example are dyestuffs that from my experience need a little more persuasion. I really like the yellows of weld on wool, and yellows will be the main hue for this Spring project. As a brief follow-on from yesterday\'s post, examples of handwriting using the same monoprint method. Yes you do need to write in mirror style. So I am constantly telling myself: b is d and d is b...... These will become something more in the near future. Thank you very much for all your comments re: yesterdays monoprint drawing post. I\'m pleased you found it interesting. A drawing and its inky shadow.... the various attempts I made, working toward the one drawing I decided to use. I had the idea of a figure seated on a chair, a shape of a figure rather than a detailed human person. But the figure wears shoes. And the chair, because chairs are one of my \'things\', had to be just a very simple form. The figures are all rather bizarre because I drew with my eyes closed. Yes, I do like a challenge.... but I knew this was the way for me to get the result I had in mind.... Above are photos I took whilst working on drawings for my latest zine \'dreamers\' (still a few copies available in my shop ). Today (no mosaic this Monday, next week) - I thought I would finally write about my own approach to making monoprint drawings. I\'ve written before, but several people have asked me to explain a little about how etc.. and I\'m happy to put this post together, as my own technique and approach changes over time. Making these drawings does not require a printers press or any other specialist equipment. I like to make things that require the most basic of things: needle and thread, paper and pencil, and for monoprint drawing: ink/paint, glass, paper, drawing tool. I use a sheet of glass from an old picture frame. I use either printers ink (the type you might use for lino) or water-mixable oil paint. In recent times I have preferred the latter as I like the thickness and texture of the paint, it has a slow drying time and allows a variety of results: from very inky and dark, to cloudy, to light and fine lines. The paint/ink is spread across the glass quite evenly and if you prefer you can use a roller, but I use my fingers because I like the slight uneven and fingerprinty result. When I am making monoprint drawings I am working toward an expressive image, perhaps primitive, minimalist even. There are some drawings that are more elaborate but mostly I\'m not aiming toward the fine exactness of an etching, for example. I\'m happy to play with chance. My drawings with pencil are very different. When I draw in my sketchbook (see sketchbook sundays posts for examples), I use the eraser as a tool for both editing and blending. And I will make many adjustments sometimes before I get a pencil drawing just so. With monoprint drawing there is no rubbing out and editing a certain area, though you can work with \'mistakes\' and go with the flow. A sheet of paper is placed over the inked glass and then you draw. Once you have finished drawing, you flip over the paper and there is your monoprinted image. I draw with a long darning needle. So when I am drawing I am just denting gently into the paper and not making any easily seen impression. I have to work in good light so that I can see the finely dented lines. Or I can take advantage of not seeing my drawing and can work \'blind\', which offers interesting results too. Either way, I have to be careful not to lean on the paper too much, although a few inky smudges made my fingers holding the paper in place are quite acceptable and desirable for me. It\'s all about finding your own style and technique of working, of course. I\'m showing many examples here but urge anyone who wishes to try monoprint drawing to draw in their own way and to learn through experience, which does take paper and time. Finding your own way of making marks is that big leap toward feeling like you are making something that is truly your own. I can get inspired by other artists, of course, but return again and again to my own obsessions..... Here\'s an example of quite a tiny drawing - showing you the inked glass image too. You can see here there is a modest about of paint smeared across the glass. This drawing was made after several previous drawings. Here\'s the first drawing I made during a brief session this morning. I had prepared the glass and left it a short while to allow the water-based oil paint to dry just a little. I thought I would work on a simple series of drawings to demonstrate - so chose one of my \'things\' - long-eared things, rabbits and hares.... I made a series of little quirky rabbit drawings. Because my inked glass was smaller than the paper area, I lifted and shifted the paper, so that\'s why the glass does not match up with the drawing! I attempted to draw a girl holding a rabbit. Wishing to aim for a quite primitive drawing. You can see my attempts starting left to right. I like the first drawing best - because it features an echo of a previous drawing left in the ink, and because I like the really smudgy drawings. Shadow girl and rabbit Various drawings showing the different quality of line achieved in one drawing session. Here you can see my first drawing in the centre and then as I continued to draw so I switched paper to a smoother cartridge paper that is best for showing fine line. Further tips: experiment with using different inks, paints and colours. Do not limit yourself to one type of paper. I also try and use old envelopes, fabric, tissue paper etc.... If you are wishing to try this with young children or less able folk, and would prefer not to use glass - then try very glossy paper or plastic folders. Just smear the paint/ink across very thinly and experiment. I\'ve made drawings in the past using the cover of an old magazine as my \'glass\'. You can also use perspex of course. Instead of drawing with a needle as I do, other drawing tools to use are of course etching tools, pointed tips of ceramics tools, sharpened pencils, cocktail sticks. I hope this post has been both insightful and interesting to you. This week I am very busy working toward many new things for my shop update on the 24th. I\'m also dyeing lots of wool for a particular project but I\'ll write about that tomorrow. Have a happy Monday x This last one is still in progress. It is in my new A3 size moleskine - so much bigger. This book will be a challenge for me. I\'ve still quite a lot of work to do on this one, I feel, but have taken a shot just to record where I am at today. You never know, this one might change quite radically or may wait a while before I work on it some more. I\'ve also been writing notes toward new poems. And spinning dyed wool to knit a Spring throw. I\'ll share more of this project next week. It has been Mothering Sunday in the UK today. A lovely Spring day. I hope you had a good one. A \'yesterdays\' in grey and gold.... I wanted to make a more elaborate doll - with ruffles. Her skirt is edged with vintage velvet ribbon. She is a \'salon couture ruffles\' kind of girl. Thank you for your kind comments/feedback re: my zine! I am pleased to know those who have received (UK people mostly of course) are enjoying this one. This helps me to know, cheers me as I continue to think on new ideas for both drawing and poetry. I wish you a very good weekend x A drawing from my sketchbook printed on to cotton and made into a small pillow. The pillow measures 5 inches tall and is filled with a mix of lavender with polyester stuffing. The reverse side is grey cotton (hand dyed with alkanet). I love lavender and lavender pillows. They can come in so many shapes and sizes. I\'ve also sewn, for myself, a very simple linen dyed with alkanet pillow. I just like things very simple, some times. And as much as I love spring colours, I\'m also in love with grey all year round. Perhaps this is why I like pencil drawings, pebbles, grey foliage plants, grey dresses and grey rabbits. 1. winter into spring , 2. Untitled , 3. day 64 , 4. mulberry eye , 5.

Untitled Created with fd\'s Flickr Toys A bright, frosty start to the week here! Many thanks to the artists and photographers featured here for sharing their work via my Flickr contacts. I\'ve chosen a gentle selection, letting in the light and shade of Spring.... it really does, finally, feel as if we are moving toward the next brighter season here. Just a few flowers can make such a big difference. This week I\'ve plenty to do, as always. I\'ve got packages to send out following my shop update (thank you). There are still a few copies of my zine available. My next update will be in a few weeks time. I\'ll put the date here on the blog when it is decided. There will be more yesterdays! I only had a few in last Friday\'s selection - I shall offer a few more next time, as I do get requests and thanks. Also, my natural dyed fabrics are currently \'coming soon\' in the shop. This means I am busy dyeing new new new - and by the end of this week I hope to have enough stock to make available again. Thanks for your interest. I\'m enjoying my recent drawing and writing notes toward new poems. I\'ve not updated nevering for a while. This is because I am working toward new poems for a collection - this takes time and there is a slow brew of ideas coming..... Spring usually brings a new energy to my writing. As I watch the birds and the sun lengthens the day, so my notebooks might get a little more inspired. It is paying attention to the small details of the day and a,\'ing these together, making something a little magical from the mix.... There are a few collaborative projects I am working on and I\'ll share more about them soon. Looking ahead to April already, I am thinking of doing some kind of month-long project. Perhaps like my November painted book. But I am still thinking on..... I hope you have a very good week and more soon x new sketches in my small moleskine sketchbook This weekend I spent some time in the garden tidying, seeing the bulbs I planted last Autumn making their way through. Lovely.... But it was cold so I worked quickly and took tea breaks, and sketched..... enjoy the rest of your Sunday
Dreaming of traveling to Buenos Aires, Argentina? The makers of Bueno, entonces... , the hot new Spanish language learning software , are trying to build their Facebook cred by reaching 10,000 Fans by March. If they get there, one lucky fan and a friend will win a trip to Buenos Aires, Argentina , for 10 days of intensive Spanish lessons, a chance to meet the cast and crew (and me, too!) and of course, have way too much fun. From now until March 12th, Bueno, entonces... is offering a series of contests on the Facebook Page, which offers free daily Spanish phrases, words and grammar lessons. 100 participants will be chosen as Finalists from the series of contests and will be entered to win the Grand Prize Trip. The complete contest details are posted on the Bueno, entonces...Fan Page . They\'ve to a super-simple photo contest. To enter, just snap a picture of yourself holding a sign saying\'I want to win a trip to Argentina\'and post it to their Facebook wall. Then get your friends to \'like\' and comment on it. But HURRY! The TEN finalists with the most \'likes\' will be selected on Friday (February 5). So polish up your tango shoes and hurry and go check it out. About the program: Bueno, entonces... is like Rosetta Stone meets The Simpsons - the program is comprehensive, but at the same time hilarious and really engaging. Just released last year, it has been already featured in the iTunes App Store and on the Daily Candy website. To see more, check out their Learn Spanish website . I have taken my share of Spanish classes, believe me. Some were good, some were...not so good. But none were as funny or as motivating as the Bueno, entonces... program. Witty and wry, with more than a bit of adult humor, it\'s like watching a favorite TV show--you can\'t wait for the next episode! Though it\'s definitely geared to the twentysomething crowd, even old folks like Tom and me laughed out loud during many of the lessons. It\'s sexy--in a fun way. And since this is the Sexy Spanish Club blog, well, I feel that I must recommend this as it is THE sexiest Spanish-learning program out there. The two characters--the hot Argentine teacher (Jimena) and the kinda goofy student (David) definitely develop a certain...chemistry. It makes it fun. Will they--or won\'t they? I\'m not telling. ;-) For those planning on visiting Argentina, you should know that this is the ONLY Argentine-oriented Spanish program available. It tells you how to pronounce things the Argentine way and includes plenty of cultural references and helpful (and entertaining) slang. Plus, it\'s portable: it can be instantly downloaded to your iPod, iPhone, Smartphone, or laptop. No need for that sweaty bus or Subte ride to a class, and no books to lug around--just plug in and learn...and laugh! What are you waiting for, gringo? Get started on your own sexy Spanish here . No, not really. Though it\'s true that my husband and I just bought a small farm in Uruguay , we are keeping our studio apartment in Buenos Aires and plan to visit regularly. After all, it\'s only two hours away and we have two daughters living in Buenos Aires and many friends--and though we plan to live a quiet life in the country (focusing on farming and writing) we will want a blast of city life every now and then! Why did we buy the farm? It was unexpected. We visited some friends--an expat couple, British and French, who had spent twenty years in New York--who had just purchased a farm. We saw how they were living, and it was just so appealing that we couldn\'t get the idea out of our heads. Two weeks later, we\'d bought our own place (or at least, started the process). The real estate transaction went very well--quick, smooth, very nice owners who worked with us directly without using an agent. What appeals to us about it is the challenge of living even more simply , of connecting to the land, developing (re-developing...I grew up on a farm) our skills in terms of planting, growing and harvesting our own food, and living in a 90-year-old farmhouse without succumbing to our American instincts to redo and rebuild. It\'s beautifully simple as is, but not perfect--and we are looking forward to being okay with that. Most of all, we love the idea of investing in land, of being in a beautiful place and getting to know our neighbors in a setting that encourages cooperation, bartering, and sharing. And okay, I can\'t help but think that it will be a really fun place for our eventual grandkids to visit. ;-) But Buenos Aires is in my heart and always will be. I love it, and I really appreciate the creativity of the people (locals and expats). It inspires me, makes me think, makes me laugh, and helps me appreciate life. I know I\'ll feel the same way about life on the farm in Uruguay--but in different ways. Thought I\'d update this blog--I\'m posting regularly on my New Globals blog these days. I\'ve even posted some fun little videos about finding my book in Barnes &amp; Noble and meeting my agent for the first time (I wrote the book in Argentina and did everything via email!) and most recently, seeing my book in a bookstore window here in New York . My book , The New Global Student: Skip the SAT, Save Thousands on Tuition, and Get a Truly International Education , was published by Random House on the 19th, and Tom and I are in New York for a month. Generally, authors do a book tour sort of thing, but we\'re doing things differently ! We\'ve had a great time hanging out with three of our daughters here, celebrated when our oldest earned her master\'s degree (at 23) and started a new job this week, and just enjoying life in the East Village. We were excited to see the print edition of Smithsonian Magazine on the racks this week! As I\'m sure many of you know, their cover story for the June edition is about living in Buenos Aires, and several expats are quoted, including me. Thanks for that, Daniel Politi! ;-) The interview was done well over a year ago, but the timing worked out very well as it was published the same week as my book launched ! There was a glitch in the shipment of books to the many education bloggers, organizations and others who were supposed to receive an early copy in order to build some buzz. We found out just last week that the books are still sitting in the warehouse ! Argh. This seriously hampers marketing efforts, as you can imagine, so we\'re doing a little damage control and scrambling. In fact, things are likely to pick up in a big way soon: later this week, a short feature on the book will be published in USA Today and a review is scheduled to appear in the Boston Globe either the 7th or the 14th (Sunday editions). I\'ve had some radio interviews and podcasts so far and Tom and I are learning a lot in our lunch sessions with parents (a group of parents buys us lunch, we listen to their concerns about their kids\' education and share tips). In fact, we had a fabulous one in Westport, Connecticut last Friday with a dozen people in attendance. Tom was the only guy, but hey, he\'s used to that. Most of all, we\'re just enjoying the moment and feeling grateful for the opportunity to have a book published and get a chance to share this message with those who can benefit from it. If you or someone you know is strugging with college costs, disheartened by the college-prep hassle, looking for inexpensive ways to study abroad, or just ready to hear some GOOD news about U.S. education , I hope you\'ll consider reading or recommending my book! Learn more at http://www.NewGlobalStudent.com It\'s also full of inspiring stories and helpful advice for anyone-- especially families --considering spending time abroad. And to all you aspiring writers in Buenos Aires and elsewhere---keep at it! Two years ago, I had no idea what I would write about and though I hoped I\'d write a book someday, I was like millions of other people with the same vague dream. Keep dreaming, but more importantly, keep writing! You just never know where it can take you. Yep. It\'s true. Oh, it\'s not that we don\'t love it. It\'s been fantastic. We chose this location (just on the edge of Belgrano) three years ago when we had two daughters living with us, and it couldn\'t have been more perfect in terms of proximity to their schools--Islands International School and Universidad de Belgrano, and an easy bus or train ride to Lincoln University College. Just a couple of blocks from the Subte D line (Congreso de Tucuman stop, so you almost always get a seat!) and four blocks from the NuÒez train station, with bus 29 running right in front of our apartment as well. We have great neighbors and our sweet little street is quiet with very friendly people. Our building? Love it. Only three years old, with a lovely pool and parilla area on the roof, a small gym, and a large sauna. There are only two apartments on each floor, and ours is facing the back instead of the street. Despite the fact that we\'re only a couple of blocks from Cabildo, what wakes us up in the morning is birds in the trees below (we\'re on the seventh floor). So, why are we selling it? Well, regular readers will know that I just wrote a book and in May, Tom and I will be going to the US for the book launch and promotional tour...and we have no idea how long we will be staying. It could be two months, but it might be six or eight months, depending on speaking engagements and other opportunities. Also, we purchased a studio apartment in Palermo, right on Paraguay (between Armenia and Malabia) that has been under construction and will be completed in the next month or so. PLUS, our four daughters seem reasonably launched and as empty nesters, we just don\'t need three bedrooms. We really like to change things up, and we\'ve always wanted to try living in a studio apartment, so Tom and I are excited to move into the little one. That means we\'ve decided to sell this one, despite our daughters\' concerns (we\'ve assured them that we\'re likely to buy another place--with at least a spare bedroom--once we get back here after the tour stuff is over). Luckily, the wonderful realtor who sold us this place--Javier--is a friend and is helping us sell this one as well. He works with Cristian Bau realtors here in Buenos Aires and he\'s such a good man, a pleasure to work with and we trust him completely. By the way, buying property here isn\'t hard as long as you\'ve got the cash since there aren\'t really any mortgages--we saw this place, bought it and MOVED INTO IT--all within a month. So, anyway--if you or someone you know might be interested in buying a really nice three-bedroom, two bath apartment in a great location--and we\'re happy to sell most of the furnishings as well for a VERY reasonable price--let us know. It\'s been a fantastic place for our family and I know that whoever ends up lucky enough to live here next will enjoy it as much as we have. To see the listing with photos, go to: (SOLD--NEVER MIND!) Maya is hard at work on her other blogs so I (her husband Tom) wanted to use her traffic to recommend a guided kayak tour of the Delta that I took last week. I have been up to Tigre and the Delta several times, it is only about 30 minutes from our apartment in Belgrano via train. Though the town of Tigre itself is worth a trip, I generally skip it to get out to the islands in the Delta. Generally we have taken the Interisla Collectivos (passenger boats that act as buses between the islands) and have gotten off at a restaurant pier or someplace else to go hiking. We have also rented a house for a weekend. But, what I really wanted to do was explore the myriad of small canals and channels that the larger boats cannot get into. Based on fellow expat Jonathan Harada\'s advice ( http://tutoramigos.blogspot.com ) we contacted Martin at www.eldoradokayak.com . Martin met us at the station and had already purchased tickets for the collectivo (boat) out to their island camp. I have been on the same route before though it was totally different as Martin is very knowledgeable about the Delta and during the entire 1.5 hour boat ride he gave us great information about the route. The last stop of the collectivo is their camp/house. Serenely quiet, the small canal had very few houses. All that we could hear was the winds in the leaves and the chirping of the birds. Martin\'s partner Chapa had a light lunch ready for us, set nicely around a picnic table in the jungle clearing. Their house is simple but new, clean with full changing and shower facilities. After a brief instruction on pa,\'ling techniques we set off in double and singles--very stable kayaks that were almost brand new. Time is different in the Delta and the two-three hours we spent blissfully pa,\'ling the small canals and channels flew by. My two daughters were hesitant to go initially (worried they were not strong enough) and completely enjoyed the experience. Our route took us through darker narrow passages as well as past grand houses on one of the larger rivers and then into seemingly untouched portions of jungle. When we got back, a lovely lunch of sausage sandwiches, tomato salad and vino patero awaited. Chapa and Martin are wonderful conversationalists and our hour lunch turned into a three hour (again time in the Delta is different) discussion of Argentine politics, culture and life on the Delta. When you visit Buenos Aires take this tour, you will not be disappointed. I have traveled a fair bit and the Delta is like nowhere I have been before and Eldorado Kayaks let me see it up close and personal. Some people like to do the look-back-over-the-last-year thing on December 31st. I prefer to do the what-a-cool-year-it\'s-going-to-be thing on New Year\'s Day. For the Frost family, lots of good things are in store and already in motion. Observe: --My book, The New Global Student , will be in bookstores on May 19th. So the next six months will be devoted to pre-launch publicity as well as sketching out Book Two. Lots of exciting times ahead as we start to get media attention for the book! --Tom and I are working together. We worked together as English teachers in rural Japan when we met back in 1983, and over the years, we\'ve had businesses together and worked side by side. But we\'ve always had our own projects. This year, I am very excited that he will be working directly with me on the business/nonprofit projects related to my book! We\'ve always been far better together than apart, so there\'s no stopping us now! ;-) --Our oldest daughter (she is 22) will complete her master\'s in May. She\'s been working full time in a,\'ition to earning her master\'s so May will bring some relief but also new opportunities. Cool! --Daughter Number Two (just turned 21) graduated from college in December and finished two internships in Manhattan--one at a Latino ad agency, one at MTV international. Now, she is very happily working in an Irish pub (she LOVES it!) while saving money and also working as a freelancer for the ad agency. It\'s great to learn how to do freelance work (and negotiate for good pay) at the age of 21. This weekend, she is moving into a new apartment (she\'s been living with her older sister since August) and is thrilled to be living in New York and doing her thing. --Daughter Number Three also graduated from college in December (she is 19) and was offered a job as a multilingual events coordinator for a major cruise line. Unfortunately, the earliest they can place her in a position is March, so she is arriving in Buenos Aires today to spend the next couple of months relaxing, traveling and possibly pursuing other work options if the cruise thing is taking too long. --Daughter Number Four (she is 18) is here in Buenos Aires now on her winter break from college in upstate New York. It\'s a chance to visit us, visit her boyfriend (okay, we know he gets top billing) and see what it\'s like to come back to Argentina after being away for a few months. She\'s going to meet her boyfriend\'s family out in the campo (country) for a few days, which should be interesting. She\'ll return to New York in a couple of weeks, continue her studies, and do an internship this summer. It looks like she\'ll graduate with a BS in Applied Psychology (organizational psych, really) in December. It\'s a year of growth, opportunities and changes--exactly what we love best. ;-) Happy New Year, everyone! Tom and I had a great time at Normal 0 Mar de AjÛ--just the two of us, the beach, the sun. Though I expected more wistful moments--this being our first Christmas in 22 years without kids--there were actually just a few, and we thoroughly enjoyed celebrating Christmas in a sleepy beach town. It\'s not sleepy now, though--the holiday crowds were arriving as we left! There was much painting and sprucing up being done during the time we were there. It was great to be the only foreigners around--everywhere we went, people asked where we were from, were very friendly and interested and we had delightful conversations with the locals we met. Not so nice--I caught Tom\'s cold (I guess I had time to get sick, so I did!) and thanks to some pretty horrible coughing yesterday, I seem to have a cracked (or at the very least, very sore) rib. So, just as I was during my recovery from gum surgery a few months back, I am VERY QUIET. It hurts to breathe, let alone talk, laugh or (OUCH!) cough. But the good news is that I got my first blurb for my book--from Dan Pink , author of A WHOLE NEW MIND. I loved Dan\'s book so I am utterly thrilled and humbled and awed that he wrote such a nice blurb for my book cover. Here it is:\'With considerable verve and tremendous insight, Maya Frost offers a primer on how to take your education -- and your life -- into your own hands. THE NEW GLOBAL STUDENT is essential reading for any family yearning to step off the treadmill and plunge into the world.\'-- Daniel H. Pink, author of A WHOLE NEW MIND Nice, huh? I am looking forward to getting more blurbs soon--they are being sent to my editor at Random House/Crown and she is out of the office until January 6th. Dan just sent his along to me as a courtesy since he knew I was on pins and needles. It\'s especially meaningful coming from Dan as he is a father of three and took his kids on a sabbatical to Japan while doing research for his manga career guide, The Adventures of Johnny Bunko . So...quiet....and thrilled. Not a bad way to spend the next couple of days. ;-)
Is your mouth watering yet? After about eating my weight in strawberries this weekend, I pureed the rest and tested out this Strawberry Lemonade Bar recipe from Baking Bites .&nbsp; It is fabulous! These perfectly pink beauties are going to be one of many treats on a dessert buffet I am putting together for an upcoming church party.&nbsp; I\'m no Amy Atlas , but I\'m really excited to do a dessert buffet. Do you know of any wonderful pink desserts? Thanks for subscribing! Last night I went out with a bunch of mama\'s from Oscar\'s playgroup.&nbsp; And I realized beforehand that I don\'t have any bags that aren\'t a diaper bag, tote bag, or something else large enough to accommodate sippy cups and goldfish crackers. So ... I made this little clutch using the Scrappy Clutch tutorial at From an Igloo . It was a quick (like during nap time quick) and easy project - my favorite kind!&nbsp;&nbsp; The only change I made was to pleat the bottom of the bag instead of gathering it, because my lining fabric was too thick and refused to be gathered. It is a wee bag that will only hold the essentials, but it was such a relief to not lug a big bag out the door!&nbsp; I think I like it as a clutch and love it as a make-up bag.&nbsp;&nbsp; I\'m going to try again with something of my own design, longer, maybe narrower, and this time I think I\'ll cut my fabric more thoughtfully so the pattern lines up nicely (duh). In a bit of non-craft business, can I just rave about Santa Barbara for a moment?&nbsp; Oscar and I were at the park today when I spotted a little meadow, chock-full of yellow daisies.&nbsp; It spoke to me.&nbsp; It sai,\'dcome over here and frolic and take pictures of your adorable son!\'&nbsp; So I did, and it was kind of great. And then on the drive home, I saw the strawberry van that is always parked on the side of the road with a sign that says,\'Picked Today!\'and couldn\'t pass it up.&nbsp; I really like living in the center of the strawberry-growing universe. p.s. sorry to those of you living in winter wonderlands.&nbsp; :) Thanks for subscribing! Someone had a magical time at Disneyland ... Oscar proved himself a little daredevil, and went on every ride with me.&nbsp; We had so much fun! We\'ve been spending the last several days trying to feel human again after too much partying and not enough napping.&nbsp; I think we\'re just about there. Sorry I don\'t have anything new to share today!&nbsp; Craft time is resuming tonight. Thanks for subscribing! Some of the best people in the world flew into California for the weekend and we are all spending a couple of days at Disneyland.&nbsp; No crafts to be spoken of ... just fun rides, a monte cristo sandwich , lots of board games, and hopefully a good dose of child-like wonder. I made some simple mickey shirts for our little guys to wear, freezer paper stenciled, as usual.&nbsp; I keep getting the same question - where can you buy freezer paper?&nbsp; You should be about to find it at any grocery store.&nbsp; I buy Reynold\'s brand, and it is usually right next to the aluminum foil and saran wrap. Have a happy weekend! Thanks for subscribing! Time for another maternity refashion.&nbsp; I found this blue t-shirt on clearance at Target for $1.50 (sorry there\'s no\'before\'photo).&nbsp; It was about two sizes larger than I would buy pre-pregnancy, which was perfect for the refashion. All I did was a,\' 1/4\'elastic to both side seams.&nbsp; I started just below the bust, secured the elastic with a few stitches, and then stretched the elastic as I sewed down the seam using a zig-zag stitch (the more you stretch the elastic, the more gathered the fabric will be).&nbsp; I stopped the elastic about 1/2\'above the bottom hem of the shirt. Here\'s what it looks like from the inside (not my tidiest work, but oh well): Very easy!&nbsp; You still have plenty of room for the growing bump, and don\'t have to wear a tent.&nbsp; Hurray for that. Thanks for subscribing! We\'re having a girl!&nbsp; I sure hope my sewing machine is up to the task. Thanks for subscribing! I finally finished my totes and burp cloths for my giveaway winners last night.&nbsp; Sorry they took so long to sew, ladies!&nbsp; I\'m putting them all in the mail today. girlfiend and Meghan will be recieiving a spring tote.&nbsp; Do you love this fabric like I do?&nbsp; It is called Flourish Floral Tiles Turquoise by Studio e Fabrics .&nbsp; &nbsp; If you want to make one for yourself, just follow my easy Spring Tote Tutorial (now updated with a,\'itional fabric dimensions if you don\'t want to use tea towels)! &nbsp; &nbsp; Lizzy will receive a set of 4 baby burp cloth s.&nbsp; I really love this flannel - it is bright and cheery. &nbsp; That\'s all for now.&nbsp; I have a big doctor\'s appointment today.&nbsp; Any predictions on if I\'ll get to use the pink baby blanket I\'ve been crocheting all week? Thanks for subscribing! This weekend was my hubby\'s 30th birthday.&nbsp; I\'ve always thought that 30 is the perfect age.&nbsp; Prime of your life. Anyway, I had plans to continue the geek-cake tradition started last year, but Jared requested a chocolate pie.&nbsp; I needed something special and homemade to a,\' to his birthday, so I made him a freezer paper stenciled space invaders t-shirt using this cross-stitch pattern as my guide. &nbsp; While I was in stencil-mode, I made a birthday t-shirt for me and Oscar.&nbsp; Oscar\'s said\'I love da,\'y\'and mine said\'I love Jared.\'Jared was so embarrassed when I wore my shirt out in public.&nbsp; But if you can\'t proclaim your love on a t-shirt, what\'s the point?&nbsp; :) &nbsp; Thanks for subscribing!
If you knew me when, you\'d know I used to watch many more movies than I do now. When I started with Netflix in 2004, I saw about 300 movies each year. Lately, I\'ve managed one DVD from Netflix each week, and one theatrical title each week. I saw only 171 movies in 2009! Pitiful. The Netflix Rating Granulizer for Greasemonkey does exactly that. Install this extension in your browser, and you\'ll be able to assign ratings with half a star. I used it to give The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus 3.5 stars. It\'s better than OK, but I didn\'t really like it. I have rated over 3000 titles on Netflix.com. I use Netflix as my main repository of movie ratings. I like to know how I rated a movie, in case someone asks me. Sometimes I can\'t remember if I\'ve seen a movie, or if I liked it enough to see it again, so I refer to my Netflix rating. Having to refer to Netflix is inconvenient sometimes. I don\'t want to have to start over from scratch with ratings on every movie Web site. What if I quit Netflix? What\'s going to happen to all those ratings? Now I can keep them. The LikeMinds Web app allows you to take your Netflix ratings with you, or move them from one Web site to another. Right now, you can export ratings from Amazon, Blockbuster, Flixster, Imdb, Movielens, Netflix, RottenTomatoes, and Yahoo, and import to Amazon, Blockbuster, Movielens, Netflix, and RottenTomatoes. They will be a,\'ing others. It took about 10 minutes for my 3030 ratings to be imported from Netflix into LikeMinds.com. It took about a minute to download them to a file on my laptop. It\'s in alpha at the moment, so they are looking for feedback on problems or features and are quick to respond. Let me know if you use it, and what your experience is. Netflix has been around for 12 years. I can hardly believe it was already seven years old when I joined in 2004. However, there are still folks out there who have never joined. I was at the doctor\'s office a few weeks ago, and was shocked that my nurse didn\'t know how Netflix worked. I reckon alot of you never considered trying Netflix until someone gave you a gift subscription. So, if you got Netflix for Christmas, and you are a total newbie, please leave a comment. I\'d love to meet you. Tell us what you think. The Leonard Maltin iPhone/iPod Touch app I posted about is on sale at the iTunes store for $2.99, down from $4.99. It\'s based on his paperback movie guide. I reckon the price drop is because of how slow the search feature is. Also, you can\'t find things by keyword. You have to know the exact title or name, or at least the beginning letters. If you search for movie titles containing the word\'Henry\', you\'ll get Henry V, but not The Private Life of Henry VIII. Even with these problems, I still love and recommend the app. Get it while it\'s on sale, and you\'ll get free updates when they fix these problems. Netflix recommends I watch Wings of Desire (1987) , and predicts that I will give it 3.9 stars , based on my feelings for Nosferatu the Vampyre (with Bruno Ganz), Downfall (a great movie also starring Bruno Ganz) and Big (!). The problem is I\'ve already seen it. I rented it from Netflix in 2006 and rated it 3 stars . I guess it went out of print and then a new edition was made, but the rating I gave it in 2006 didn\'t transfer from that edition to this. I don\'t remember exactly why I gave it a lower rating. Should I re-rate it 3 stars, in total disagreement with what Netflix knows about me? Or trust Netflix? I feel bad for disagreeing with the Netflix prediction of my rating, because they spent a million dollars to improve their recommendations. Two things of note: I love Bruno Ganz, as an actor, and I rate every movie I\'ve seen on Netflix.com. I am thrilled to learn from a comment left here by Ken, that Leonard Maltin\'s Movie Guide is now available on the iPhone and iPod Touch . I bought mine from the App Store for $4.99, which is a third of what the book costs. The advantages of it over other applications is that you don\'t have to be connected to the Internet to look up movie details. You get plot summaries, star ratings, cast and director. You can search the database by title, cast, or director to get filmographies. I do this all the time when I\'m out with friends. We\'ll be talking about movies and they ask me what other movies has an actor been in? What other movies has someone directed? They think I\'m the movie expert, and I keep them impressed by using Leonard Maltin\'s Movie Guide. Another advantage is that you can create your own custom lists or a,\' to Favorites or Movies to See which you can backup online. There\'s also a button to a,\' movies to your Netflix queue (requires an Internet connection). I\'ve been waiting for this ever since I gave up my Palm T|X. A good movie guide was the only thing I missed about that Palm. I left a note on Leonard Maltin\'s Web site, asking that they make an app for the iPhone. I reckon I wasn\'t the only one who wanted it. Now my iPod Touch is complete. If you don\'t have iTunes or an iPhone, check out the developer\'s Web site for screenshots and more info. P.S. No one paid me or gave me anything to write this review. It\'s time again for the ONE MONTH FREE TRIAL CARDS from Netflix.

The little copper tree and the wood on which it sits were sent to me by Aleph. I a,\'ed the birthday candle and the little figures (about 1/2 inch tall). This twisting tree reminded me of the Wallace Stevens poem On the Road Home. I tried something pretty simple with this- instead of blending bits of the three photographs I liked, I just stacked them, I think this reflects the mood of mutability in the poem.Alice picks up the red king chesspiece, who does not know what force is lifting him through the air. Feeling at the mercy of forces beyond our control frequently results in reverting to the primitive (did someone say reptilian brain?).
14 x 5\'About five years back, when I was just starting to paint, I emailed a well-known artist and asked him to take a look at my work and tell me what I was missing. He offered one comment that stuck with me - to pay as much attention to the edges as the content. I was too tight - too illustrative. And it\'s not what I wanted to achieve - I wanted to find the balance of details needed and leave the rest to impression. With each and every painting, I have to pay great attention to that fine line - not to say there are days when I desire to tighten up and other times I desire to really lay on the painterly strokes. I don\'t have a favorite feature in this new piece - I love all of it. That final dab of light blue on the bathing suit mattered, although I don\'t know what made me do it other than intuition. The edges are just as I want - allowing some to be rough and some soft.

There\'s plenty of room to not only get up close, but to back up a good 30 - 40 feet and take it all in. When I was a teenager, I would sit on the floor in front of this masterpiece and draw dozens of versions of parts of this urban scene - not knowing I\'d paint it dozens of times thirty years later. My favorite feature of this new piece is the man on the far right, on his way out. I have wanted to a,\' more movement in figures - a slight blur or even a ghost of a shape - just knowing when it\'s right is the tough part. And knowing how to get the idea across, without looking like my hand smudged the paint unintentionally is even harder. It\'s something I\'m working on more and more, mostly behind the scenes.

The two figures were wonderful to paint, especially the woman who has that great S-shaped posture. Included front and center is Georgia O\'Keeffe\'s \'Black Cross, New Mexico\', one of my all-time personal favorites in the Art Institute of Chicago.

And remember, brighter days are ahead. Not soon enough - but it\'s coming. My first thought about this new painting is it can best be appreciated in person. The vibrancy of the skin tones, the yellow towel and especially the turquoise water and multi-blues sky - the texture and warmth in the sand, which I used a palette knife for most of that - yes, I wish I could hold up the real thing right in front of you. As with most paintings. In the process of painting this, I did the figure first, the water next, the people walking about and in the ocean way in the distance - and then wiped the whole thing off. Those moments are funny - here I just spent hours on what I thought was nearly complete and it\'s as if my hand just took over and grabbed a rag and, in seconds, trashed it. So I sit there stunned for a minute, hearing that little voice that assures me it wasn\'t right and get over it. Just as quick as it disappeared, I start it all over again - lessons learned - which usually makes the second attempt much more successful. Now.... mix yourself a margarita and click here for a larger view and purchase information. 12 x 12\'I may have said this before - when I\'m in a museum, I find myself so focused on looking at people rather than the art. It\'s been an obsession since I was a kid - watching the human figure and studying how we move, stand, balance, sit ...... all of it. And when I start a painting, there\'s always something that stands out right away - a feature that is essentially why I\'m interested in the photograph in the first place. In this case, I saw this gentleman and his clothes as one united, interesting form - I felt the weight of the fabric, the heavy load of the backpack and especially the zigzags created by the folds of the pants. I just love that feature. I also saw the warmth of the overall tones - the golds, reds, greys - and chose to paint a rich, paprika-like color on top of the black surface I usually start with and hoped it would peek through in parts as long as I didn\'t go too far and cover it all up. The challenge being to let the edges do what they do, without nit picking. Like here in the legs ..... I was so happy with the some of the red showing through the creamy wall and the looseness of the shadows around the Picasso - again allowing edges to overlap and disappear into each other. That\'s what I get when I stay away from small brushes - I\'m forced to take more control of the strokes but I can\'t over-paint it. This young man was studying Picasso\'s \'Mother and Child\', which hangs in the Modern Wing in the Art Institute of Chicago. Please click here for a larger view and purchase information. Booster Seat I and II each is 8 x 10\'Whew ! All of the new paintings are officially in the Morris &amp; Whiteside Gallery , currently being hung for the three-artists-show opening Friday, the 26th and I feel I can relax a little bit. And I\'m very happy to start showing you each and every painting - and if you don\'t mind - I want to a,\' to that some of my favorite details or \'sweet spots\' that make them special. Let me start with the paintings you see above - two women taking a rest on a bench in the Art Institute of Chicago. It\'s where thousands of visitors take a load off and hopefully get a boost of energy to get back to exploring. Now, you may recognize the woman on the right, I had painted her a few years back - but with this new piece, actually both paintings - I applied the oils with a palette knife, nice and thick, then carved into it with a brush, a,\'ing more detail and control. I can attest to this being more difficult and frustrating - but the challenge lies in moving the paint around, almost sculpting it in parts. Some areas have slabs of color on top of color, like in the pants and the back wall and the swirling of thick paint to move with the folds of the clothes. You may also notice, even though I\'m one of three artists in this show, I titled my work\'The Tute and a Tan\'. Let me explain how my brain works, with respect to getting the job done. I can move forward, fairly quick, if I have a specific direction. In this case, I chose to paint scenes from two of my favorite people-watching spots - the Art Institute of Chicago aka the \'Tute\' - and the beach. Once I can visualize a grouping that marries well with each other, I start working. There isn\'t an artist that doesn\'t get stuck not knowing what to paint next - and this way of thinking and preparing helps me motivate. All of my paintings in the show can be viewed here - and thank you for looking. A short video can be viewed here as well. Hope you enjoy. \'Cruise Control\' sold This might be a workshop meant for you - my second Field Expedition this year taking place November 1st - 5th at the Arts Center of Coastal Carolina on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I\'ve seen the studio space, it\'s fabulous - and like the New York City workshop, we\'ll be painting in the early part of the day and photographing in the afternoons. I picked this location because it has provided me with loads of imagery for paintings - the beach, the low-country landscapes and Savannah and Charleston are near enough for a short road trip for more. Also, the fine people at the Morris &amp; Whiteside Gallery will be hosting an evening get-together at their gallery for our group and you may also be interested in scooting over to Charleston after the workshop is over, for their Palette and Palate Stroll during the weekend. Should be great fun. More information can be found here and you can call Vince Fazio at the Sedona Arts Center for further details and registration. 6 x 6\'oil on masonite sold I am sure there\'s many of you out there that aren\'t embracing the snow right now. But remember, I live in the deep south, and this is not only a rare occurrence, it\'s an unusual opportunity for me to paint something different, and I love that. It is staggering to see my world blanketed in white - almost no hint of color anywhere - the muted, silver sky - the amazing quiet. If it wasn\'t for my slipping on the ice and dropping my camera right smack in the snow, I would say that day was a perfect day. I also get to play with thick, blended, warm and cool white paints - laid on thick and as heavy as the snow itself. So much fun. And I promise - the 18 new paintings you\'ll see in a few weeks will warm you up and remind you that brighter days are ahead.
I plan to stop being a public, personal, storyteller. Let me explain:&nbsp; I went to TED last month, which is a conference in Long Beach, and was asked to perform a 3 minute story in between speakers.&nbsp; I got up and told this story about Mulan learning about sex for the first time.&nbsp; I call it the Mulan-frog story (it begins with frogs )&nbsp;&nbsp; It got big laughs and even a partial standing ovation at the end.&nbsp; People really loved it and I was so high and happy afterwards.&nbsp; I\'m proud that I have the skill to tell a good story and make people laugh. I have a million happy memories of being onstage and making people laugh.&nbsp; There is always a dark side however.&nbsp; I am usually telling some story that could embarrass another person or I\'m talking about something that irritates me about someone specific.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I got home from the conference I realized that if Mulan saw my story (or a fellow student did) she could be very embarrassed.&nbsp; I was mortified and could not believe that I hadn\'t considered this before.&nbsp; Mulan looks good in the story   a curious, smart nine year old.&nbsp; But the whole topic is embarrassing to a girl her age.&nbsp; I was really struck deeply about what I do onstage and the fact that I have a child.&nbsp; I hated telling stories about my mother because I knew that it could be hurtful but I did it anyway because I loved getting the laugh, I loved getting to vent, and I felt I had the right somehow to talk about her onstage.&nbsp; I guess I thought there was some sort of unwritten code that made parents fair game.&nbsp; I actually feel that\'s true and if Mulan grows up and tells stories about me, no matter how unflattering, I will gladly accept that as her right.&nbsp; (I\'ll be in the front row, no   wait!&nbsp; More lovingly, I will not be anywhere near the place!) But the other way around, me telling stories about her  That\'s different. After much agonizing, little niggling things that I have hated for a long time about performing stories about my own life fulminated to the surface.&nbsp; I no longer wish to be so naked and bare.&nbsp; I am surprised I ever did want to do it.&nbsp; Don\'t get me wrong, I\'m glad I did.&nbsp; I am proud that I learned to craft my experiences into a story and I am proud that I learned the craft of being on-stage.&nbsp; But now, I need to stop doing it.&nbsp; I am happily married, for one thing, and it\'s boring and inappropriate to talk about.&nbsp; My daughter is ten and she reads my blog, (OMG!) she goes to my shows.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact we have spoken at length about the stories I tell about her.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not that, at ten, she is really capable of understanding the ramifications.&nbsp; Still, she says it\'s okay to tell the Mulan-frog story.&nbsp; But ugh.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don\'t think she really understands.&nbsp; I feel the need to protect her from myself! In some ways, this is just another example of our Internet age.&nbsp; When I started telling stories about my life, it was in a basement club in L.A. called Luna Park, in 1994, where the maximum capacity was 50 people.&nbsp; We were recording the shows, but it wasn\'t for mass consumption.&nbsp; What I mean is that I could speak as if it were \'off the record.\'&nbsp; This lulled me into a sense of secrecy and intimacy and allowed me to say anything no matter how raw.&nbsp; I was uncensored. But, there is no more \'off-the-record\' anymore.&nbsp; Anything can be posted online.&nbsp; Immediately.&nbsp; I think this is, on balance, good   it makes people accountable in a new and direct way.&nbsp; But for me   well let\'s just say I would probably never have begun telling stories about my personal life if I\'d thought they could be available to any interested person, instantly.&nbsp; But once I started, I got used to the open-nature of talking about my life.&nbsp; I learned to live with the downsides, the embarrassment, possibly even when it hurt or embarrassed other people.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, when blogging came along, it seemed like such a natural thing to do.&nbsp; Jill Sobule and I have been working for a few years now doing a show together.&nbsp; I tell about ten to fourteen stories in our show.&nbsp; (She sings songs, I tell stories)&nbsp; We have worked hard to make the show work dramatically and musically. I think we\'ve succeeded.&nbsp; In fact, I think our show is at least as good as any other show I\'ve done, maybe better.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I\'m glad I tell all those stories in our show.&nbsp; But I don\'t want to tell any more.&nbsp;&nbsp; The stories that are out there, well, they\'re out there.&nbsp; But then  after this  well, I want to retire from it.&nbsp;&nbsp; At least for a while.&nbsp; Maybe forever, I dunno. We have about 12 scheduled shows for this year (2010).&nbsp; Mostly in the summertime and mostly in the Northeast and the Northwest.&nbsp;&nbsp; After talking this over with Jill, we have agreed to do those shows.&nbsp; We may actually a,\' a show or two.&nbsp; We may also find a way to film our show in the autumn.&nbsp; But by the end of this year, I plan to stop doing this show.&nbsp; And then face 2011 not performing. I haven\'t written in my blog because I am always so suspicious of any type of big revelation or big announcement.&nbsp; I almost felt that if I announced that I was going to stop performing, there would inevitably be some reason not to stop it.&nbsp; I have mulled this over for the last month or so.&nbsp; And it feels good.&nbsp; It feels right. Sometimes I feel that my creativity, (and not just mine, but everyone\'s creativity) is like the snow on a mountaintop melting a little at a time.&nbsp; All my various outlets   performing and writing in all its manifestations -- create little rivers through which the snow can melt.&nbsp; I always liked having so many things going at once.&nbsp; I always felt that in show business, you had to have five pots on the stove just to get one of them to boil.&nbsp; I benefited from being so multi-able.&nbsp; I could do voice over and then perform at a club, I could write a monologue and then write a pilot for a TV show.&nbsp; But lately it feels that I have fragmented my focus with this policy.&nbsp; I want the snow to melt into a couple of larger rivers, not into several smaller streams.&nbsp; And so, after the TED experience, I found myself wondering what I\'m doing with myself.&nbsp; How am I directing my energies?&nbsp; I began to look at the darker side of telling stories about my personal life.&nbsp; The guilt, the anguish, the desire to emphasize this over that, the slant, the small or large exaggeration, the worry that someone I\'m talking about will see or hear me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I suppose you could say the tipping point was Mulan. Also, many things have changed.&nbsp; I am now more able to be isolated (having moved to the Midwest from Los Angeles) and conversely, I am now in more regular and intimate interdependence with people.&nbsp; I guess what I mean is that I have a husband and a child.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is already a lot of interaction in my life, and I have begun to crave more and more alone time.&nbsp; I desire privacy.&nbsp; I don\'t want my personality to be so known anymore.&nbsp; (My personality has been so slutty!&nbsp; Time to join a convent!) So, in the last few weeks I have beta-tested my new views.&nbsp; And it\'s already had such forceful and creative results.&nbsp; I am focusing on a couple of screenplays; with my writing partner Jim Emerson.&nbsp;&nbsp; I may or may not finish writing the memoir of my letting go of God time, \'My Beautiful Loss-of-Faith Story.\'&nbsp; Of course, I\'ll do the Jill &amp; Julia shows with Jill Sobule during this year.&nbsp; Then I plan to hang up my mouth.&nbsp; I can see Jill and I doing another show, someday, but not until way into the future.&nbsp; (If she wants to!) (In ten years!)&nbsp; I do honestly have that fantasy.&nbsp; Or I can imagine that I will change in a few yea rs time and want to get back up on stage.&nbsp; Or maybe I will develop the skills to talk about things that aren\'t so personal and private, like many other comics do.&nbsp; That could happen.&nbsp; But I doubt it.&nbsp; And at the very least, I doubt it for the foreseeable future. Anyway, here I am making a big pronouncement, just what I didn\'t want to do.&nbsp; I\'m trying to write this in a way that appears that I\'m mindful of the unpredictable events that could occur.&nbsp; But insofar as I can plan ahead, and insofar as I can predict my attitude, and insofar as I have the ability to point myself towards one thing over another, I feel the plan to stop talking about myself publicly is right. So, this means that I won\'t be blogging about my family.&nbsp; Or really blogging at all. I am so thankful for all the people who have read my blog and commented.&nbsp; Please, if you can, come to see one of the Jill &amp; Julia Shows this year.&nbsp; For me, this show is so meaningful; it\'s an end of an era.&nbsp;&nbsp; For 16 years I have been getting on stage and spilling my guts while simultaneously attempting to make people laugh.&nbsp; That\'s a long time.&nbsp; This decision feels like a death.&nbsp; It\'s hard to envision myself as myself without the outlet and the drive to get onstage and talk about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, it doesn\'t seem right to continue either.&nbsp; This decision feels inevitable and yet surprising and mostly very, very right.&nbsp; I\'m so excited about this, to be honest.&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine me, a private person!&nbsp; (I recently joked with Jim Emerson about how I feel I was a butterfly but I\'m morphing into a caterpillar!) I\'ll be posting all the places where Jill and I have booked shows very soon.&nbsp; Thanks for reading. Botanic Gardens, Kauai Hawaii I took this pic a few years ago when Mulan and I spent Christmas with friends in Kauai. I\'ve been thinking about Voltaire a bit. &nbsp; In our last writing session, Jim reminded me of the poem that Voltaire wrote after the Lisbon earthquake of 1755 when all the priests were railing against the people themselves for being the culprit. &nbsp;The disaster occurred because of their sinfulness. &nbsp;And now, 255 years later and we still have the like of Pat Robertson and his voodoo/pact-with-the-devil/Christian belief that Haiti brought all this on itself. Here is Voltaire\'s poem:&nbsp; Poem on the Lisbon Disaster - Wikisource And here is a good excerpt: What crime, what sin, had those young hearts conceived That lie, bleeding and torn, on mother\'s breast? Did fallen Lisbon deeper drink of vice Than London, Paris, or sunlit Madrid? In these men dance; at Lisbon yawns the abyss. Tranquil spectators of your brothers\' wreck, Unmoved by this repellent dance of death, Who calmly seek the reason of such storms, Let them but lash your own security; Your tears will mingle freely with the flood. Pat Robertson is an anomaly now. &nbsp;The public is ridiculing him. &nbsp;This makes me optimistic. &nbsp;In Voltaire\'s time it the Catholic Church was everywhere and this was the general attitude. I really think things are changing. &nbsp;SLOWLY.&nbsp; What shocks me is that while the mainstream may mock Robertson, they don\'t seem to take it a step further. &nbsp;If God didn\'t cause the earthquake then does God cause anything? Is he a sad bystander? &nbsp;Is he able to do anything about it? &nbsp;Of course not. &nbsp;Then why believe in any God at all? &nbsp;But no one takes it that far. &nbsp;It\'s PC to extoll the belief that God IS there to rely on, you can cry on his shoulder, you can ask for strength. &nbsp; Why is that so acceptable? &nbsp;&nbsp; And why did the font on my blog just change? &nbsp;OH! &nbsp;I cannot stop and noodle with it, I have dinner to prepare. Val, my cat, on my desk Here is an experimental blog post - a straight-up diary of my day. So... This was my day... Got up, nudged Mulan along as she groggily got dressed for school. &nbsp; Got her breakfast and made some coffee. &nbsp;Helped her look through her homework to make sure everything was done. &nbsp;Nudged her to finish a math page and a bonus challenge homework page. &nbsp;Gave her a pre-test for her spelling quiz. &nbsp;Nudged her to get her teeth brushed and especially to floss. After she left I took the dog, Arden on a walk to Lake Michigan. &nbsp;I listened on my iphone to an audio biography about Paul Durac, a British Theoretical Physicist. &nbsp;I am convinced he had asperger syndrome only the biographer doesn\'t mention that. &nbsp;I get jelous of Dirac\'s life where everything is arranged so he can work constantly, I wish I had a Mancy (his wife\'s name) who made sure I was undisturbed, had food, and could take long walks. &nbsp;Today as I walk it\'s very deceptively icy. The sidewalks look clear but they have the thinnest layer of ice. I almost fall down a hundred times. &nbsp;I don\'t like the cold today. &nbsp; The lake is sad looking, a lot of dirty looking piled up snow on the edge of the lake. I look closer and see that what I thought was dirt is really sand. &nbsp;I marvel at Lake Michigan and all it\'s sand. Get home and Michael is completely absorbed in some lighting project at the house. &nbsp;He is a man obsessed with lighting. &nbsp;He wants to program every single light in our house so that we can stand at the door and push one button and every light we don\'t want on will go off. This requires a lot of work, hooking up this outlet but not that one, etc. &nbsp;He is frustrated with the software for the program and it\'s the third incarnation of this software he has worked with. He has been up for two nights until at least one or two a.m. working on the lighting project. &nbsp;I kid with him and say, when he gets it done I expect him to say with glee,\'Now all you have to do to turn down the lights in the family room is log onto this website on your computer, enter a certain number, and the light will automatically dim!\'&nbsp;He does not like my joke because you see, it\'s not really a joke. I leave and go get a mammogram. I have not had one for a few years. I, having had cervical cancer, should be more vigilant, but I have let things go. &nbsp;I get to the Evanston Medical Center and read the book I am completely absorbed in.\'Lacuna\'by Barbara Kingsolver. &nbsp;It\'s such a great book, a fictionalized account of a young Mexican American in the thirties who befriends Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera and Trotsky. &nbsp; I am pulled out of my reverie by a stern woman asking me to put on a gown. &nbsp;The gown is awkwardly configured so even after you tie it in the places it wants to be tied, you have to hold it closed otherwise your whole front shows as you walk down the hallway to the mammogram machine. &nbsp;The woman inside is friendly and I\'m thankful for her warm hands as she manipulates my breasts this way and that. &nbsp;I think about what a weird job she has. &nbsp;I wonder if she says to people,\'I just sort of fell into it.\'&nbsp;There is no hi,\'en meaning in that configuration of words, I just wonder if that\'s the phrase she\'d use. As I leave we discuss the gowns. &nbsp;She agrees, they suck. I leave and take a moment to consider that I could get a bad response on my mammogram and have cancer. I fantasize what I would do if I learned I had only one year to live. &nbsp;I decide that I would just go places to look at animals and nature and the sky at night. &nbsp;I would go to the Galapagos, or Hawaii and just sit and watch. I don\'t need to see any more people, I\'ve seen big cities, but I\'ve done it. &nbsp;I get it. &nbsp;Big vibrant city. &nbsp;I crave quiet and nature without people. &nbsp;I decide that I would have to pull Mulan out of school to go with me to Hawaii or the Galapagos. &nbsp;Of course Michael would have to come, he\'d have to shut down his business and come. &nbsp;Jill Sobule would have to come too, as well as Jim Emerson. &nbsp;I guess there\'d be some people. &nbsp; Then I think, it would be bad for Mulan to be pulled out of school right now because &nbsp;she is really doing well and loves her school. &nbsp;Then I remember this is all a fantasy. &nbsp;I blink back tears and come back to life. I go to my favorite bread store in Evanston. &nbsp;It\'s Friday and I get challah. &nbsp; I don\'t ask for challah bread . &nbsp;I used to do that. &nbsp;Then Michael told me that was like asking for Guinness beer. &nbsp;You just say Guinness, not Guinness beer, just as you just say challah. &nbsp;We like to buy challah for french toast on Sundays. &nbsp; I don\'t have Mulan with me but I remember while I\'m at this store that this was where Mulan made her first decent pun. &nbsp;She said they should put a sign out on Fridays saying,\'Celebrate, it\'s Challah-Day!\'&nbsp; While I\'m at the bread store I also get a turkey sandwich on their popeye bread. &nbsp;It\'s so good, it\'s worth all the points. I come home and eat my sandwich while I watch some TV footage about Haiti. I get really upset. &nbsp;I start to cry. &nbsp;It all seems so hopeless. &nbsp;What if you were stuck and had so much time before you died to know it was going to happen? &nbsp;Or worse, you didn\'t know if your loved ones were okay or not. &nbsp;Or even what just really happened out there. &nbsp;This is happening to someone right now. &nbsp;This makes my heart heave. I answer a few phone calls. &nbsp;I speak with a woman at Minnesota Public Radio about doing a show at the Fitzgerald theater in St. Paul in March. &nbsp;It seems like it\'s going to happen. &nbsp;Then I do some business paperwork, for example, I send $1000 to Sony for the rights to sing\'Is That All There Is\'in\'Letting Go of God\'for one year. Then I try to write. &nbsp;I decide my book of essays is not as important as\'My Beautiful Loss Of Faith Story\'the book i\'ve been working on for years. I wonder if I can reach my goal of finishing it this year. I wonder how many years I\'ve had this goal. I feel depressed. &nbsp;I remember we have no food in the house and Mulan is bringing a friend home after school. &nbsp; I go to the grocery store. &nbsp;I buy chicken noodle soup and oyster crackers for Mu and her friend to have after school. &nbsp;This is Mu\'s big TV day. &nbsp;She cannot watch any TV during the week, but on Friday after school it\'s a TV free-for-all. &nbsp;I also buy vegetables and after I come home, I quickly make a pasta sauce in the slow cooker. I run to meet Mu after school, but I am a few minutes late and she is nearly home and I end up meeting her half way. She has her friend with her. Mu got 100% on her spelling quiz and I am elated. &nbsp;I heat up the chicken soup for them. &nbsp;Nadia comes over to watch the girls because I have a hair appt. &nbsp;Michael has gone to work. &nbsp;I get my hair cut really short. I really look like a nun now. And I like it. &nbsp;I feel I am in\'A Nun\'s Story\'as I leave the hair salon. &nbsp;I tell myself that if my hair is going to be this short I really have to remember to wear lipstick. &nbsp;I love my hair dresser. &nbsp;She gets my hair. I come home from the salon and Michael is already home and working on his lighting project again. Mulan is upstairs in our room watching TV. &nbsp;I make everyone eat the pasta and sauce. &nbsp;It\'s only okay, not great. &nbsp; &nbsp;I beg everyone to watch the Netflix movie I have,\'Winged Migration.\'&nbsp;I already saw it when it came out (in 2000) but it was so great - all about various birds\' migrations across the earth. &nbsp;Michael wants to work on the lighting project, Mulan wants to watch iCarly, they don\'t want to watch it. &nbsp;I\'m too tired to do anything useful. &nbsp;I briefly decide to go read my book in the basement, but then rally and force everyone to stop what they\'re doing and watch\'Winged Migration.\'&nbsp;I really have to push. &nbsp;I momentarily hate everyone and wonder why I\'m doing this. &nbsp; I think that if I\'m going to die in a year I really must finish the screenplay that Jim Emerson and I are working on. We are having so much fun. &nbsp;Working with Jim has been one of my life\'s great joys. &nbsp;Just as I\'m giving up on Mu and Michael they agree, yes, let\'s watch the movie together. &nbsp;I su,\'enly feel a huge surge of love for them. Before we watch the movie, we make popcorn in the microwave. &nbsp;Michael has experimented and experimented and if you take 1/4 cup of popcorn and a dab of oil and put it in a kid\'s paper lunch bag and staple the top, zap it for exactly 2 minutes, it turns out great. We watch. &nbsp;Michael loves the film but is skeptical about how much they doctored itto get certain types of shots. &nbsp;Mulan is rapt with the film, and so is Arden - it\'s the first time my dog watched most of a movie. &nbsp;But when it\'s over Mulan announces she\'s thrilled she\'s now let out of this horrible prison I\'ve put her in, forcing her to watch this movie. &nbsp;Also, she announces that she will never eat a bird. Ohmygod, I love my family so much. Mulan goes to her room, Michael goes back to the lighting project, and I come in here and write about my day. Snow, snow, everywhere... And I love it. Wow. &nbsp;All those posts to the last blog entry have my head in constant conversation. &nbsp; I think the post that I\'ve thought about the most was the one which indicated I was breaking the question down in a poor way. &nbsp;(Well, there were many posts pointing that out...) &nbsp;This one broke down the debate in a different way - between religion with supernatural claims and religion without supernatural claims. &nbsp; That is true. &nbsp;I guess I don\'t normally think of or remember that there are religions without supernatural claims. Bu,\'hism is the only one I can think of. (Not all sects of Bu,\'hism.) &nbsp; Or the Unitarian Church. To me, religion works best as a ritual keeper and community builder. &nbsp;These things are very important. &nbsp;In my observations - which are mostly about my upbringing in Spokane in the Catholic church and then watching my friends who have stayed in the church - the best thing they get from their religion is the shared rituals and community. &nbsp; These are the things that I really craved, in retrospect. &nbsp;I had mouthed the words and didn\'t think all that much about the readings, I liked Bach and the candles and the idea that I had stood in this same church year in and year out on one particular day that earmarked the dead of winter or the beginning of spring - saying the same things, hearing the same songs, watching kids grow up, flirting with boys, seeing who was getting married, mourning those who had died. &nbsp;All those things can be a part of a life without the supernatural. On the other hand, the supernatural specifics of what we were all supposed to believe were, in my opinion, &nbsp;a great hindrance to the development of a skeptical outlook and even general critical thinking skills. &nbsp;So, the ideas we were so benignly taught had an insidious price. &nbsp;We paid with our critical minds. &nbsp;SOME of my friends from Spokane, for example, have - in my humble opinion - undeveloped political opinions. &nbsp;Worse, they back off from any debate. &nbsp;They make ad homonym attacks. &nbsp;Tragically, some of them have no understanding of the tenants of other faiths, and even of their own faith. &nbsp;Sometimes it seems that they are even proud of their lack of information. &nbsp;Is the Church to blame? &nbsp;Hmmm... I kinda think so. &nbsp;I hate to say, I do. But the rituals and community continue to give. &nbsp;And I can see that it is a great value. I think the Unitarian Church can offer this, but not at the cost of your critical mind. But for me, I do not feel in need of the community anymore! &nbsp;I like the idea of it, but not the practicality of it. &nbsp;It involves a great deal of socializing and I feel that I am filled up with that. What I crave now, (and I am fifty, so maybe this is a natural thing to happen,) but I want less socializing and social obligation in my life. &nbsp;I crave quiet and contemplation. &nbsp;I want to learn. &nbsp;I feel I am hungry to learn and read and think, &nbsp;well, it\'s almost as if I had scurvy and were in need of an orange! &nbsp;And true learning and thinking take a lot of time and quiet. &nbsp;With a husband and a child, as well as a few very close friends, &nbsp;I feel I am up to my ears in interaction with people. &nbsp;A,\'ing a church would put me over the edge. &nbsp;Even if Mulan may benefit from it, she would have an even more frazzled mother and I don\'t think that is good. ( I could just see myself getting caught up in it at first, volunteering for five committees, no,\'ing\'yes!\'to the bake sale, and then being in the worst possible mood about it all for the next six months... &nbsp;Wait! This is what being at a public school is like already! &nbsp;I\'ve so far been able to back away from most things... &nbsp;But yes, I feel guilty about it. &nbsp;Guilty or Angry? That\'s always my dilemma... ) I think me and my friends would have been better served by a Church that did not subscribe to supernatural beliefs. &nbsp;We would have gotten the ritual and community but not the inanity. But sometimes I wonder, would we stick to it if it didn\'t have a whiff of a real God on High? &nbsp; I might not have. &nbsp;It would require inculcating me about the need of community and social obligation and not about someone looking over my shoulder who could see everything. ...I wrote the above jumbled blog entry this morning and was intending all day to get back to it, reread all those wonderful posts from the last entry and rewrite it. But now it\'s late, and I have to fly to New York in the morning. &nbsp;So I\'m just going to throw this out there. It\'s woefully inadequate in it\'s musings upon this topic. Jill Sobule and I are doing a show on Sunday night at Joe\'s Pub in New York and it\'s sold out. That is really exciting!!!! Bahai Temple, Wilmette, IL &nbsp;early Christmas morning 2009 I took this picture early this morning on my dog walk. Mulan, Michael and I opened presents, had breakfast, and then flew to L.A. &nbsp;Now I am here, and I realize how much I miss it! &nbsp;Yippity yah, five days in L.A. Not much to report, but I wrote this (below) last week and I guess I\'ll paste it here now... Amongst the non-believers of this world, there appears to be a split in thinking between: 1.) Those that think religion is good - regardless of truth - for some people. &nbsp;Religion is useful for those who are trying to get sober, for those who have no where to turn, for those that might not follow society\'s rules, for those who might not otherwise respect others, for those in complete despair, and for those that need the idea, the concept - as a new drug - to get off another one. 2.) Those who think religion and the idea of God is never good for anyone. I have always put myself in the #1 category. &nbsp; It suits me because I don\'t want to proclaim that seeing stark reality, which is very dark and full of potential catastrophe, is good, or possible for everyone. But this thinking is very condescending. &nbsp;It\'s Plato saying religion is good for the masses. &nbsp;It\'s Will Durant saying how religion helps to bind people together, and so for society it\'s good. &nbsp;It\'s AA using the idea of a higher power to get people to let go of another, actual drug. But #2 is so arrogant too. I mean this is all just for the rumination - religion and the idea of God is not going away and most likely never will - so this is all just blathering about the number of angels who can dance on the head of a pin . &nbsp;I have always stayed away from the #2 thinking because it puts me in a position of dismissing so much in others. I am not comfortable with it. &nbsp;It\'s very judgey. &nbsp;Of course, that is no way to decide what you think. &nbsp;Being&nbsp; judgey &nbsp;is the point of this whole debate! But in my private thoughts, what do I really think? &nbsp;It\'s like a little debate between Plato and Voltaire. &nbsp;Plato did think religion was good for the masses. &nbsp;Voltaire believed religion enslaved people. Truthfully, now I\'m beginning to lean towards Voltaire. I asked my husband yesterday if he thought religion did any person any good at all. &nbsp;\'Think about Anne Lamott, a nice, liberal, happy Christian,\'I said, &nbsp;\'Or people who get off drugs and alcohol because they find Jesus. &nbsp;I mean, aren\'t we all better off because of that transfer of the more dangerous drug to the more benign one?\'And he sai,\'dMaybe. But now those people are primed to follow. &nbsp;Jesus might be the idea for now, but it really could be anyone. They have made themselves programmable and basically they are sheep and now anyone could lead them - it could be to the top of a mountain or it could be off a cliff.\'Again, I am paraphrasing and a,\'ing imagery for emphasis. &nbsp;And may I remind you that I do not hang on this guy\'s every word, far from it! But I thought about that all day. &nbsp;I mean, I have always thought #1 was the benevolent point of view, the humble point of view, the less-judgemental and superior point of view, but actually that is wrong!! The #1 thinking is really so cynical and superior and #2 has all this faith &nbsp;in everyone to use rationality and critical thinking to get through. &nbsp; #2 is actually the humble - or no, the optimistic point of view! &nbsp;(Not that being humble or optimistic is some sort of proof for an argument!) &nbsp;But you know, neither of these words is right, it\'s more like empowering - it\'s the empowering point of view. I have not really come to any conclusions about this. &nbsp;But I\'m just realizing how there is this split in thinking and I\'m not sure - I vacillate between those views. Arden, in the backseat of the just-bought mini-van, as we drove from Los Angeles to Chicago, embarking a year ago today, Dec. 17, 2008. A year ago Mulan and I, after watching a moving company depart with all of our possessions, joined Michael as we drove together from California to Illinois. &nbsp;There was a huge storm which prevented us from taking the route we wished to take - through Santa Fe and instead we drove south, through Arizona and then Texas. &nbsp;It took four days. &nbsp;We had a dog in the car who wanted to kill, really truly kill and eat, the cat in the car. &nbsp;We stopped at Motel 6s, we saw billboards in Texas that proclaimed that Obama was not born in the U.S., we watched Arden pee in ice for the first time. &nbsp;It was an adventure. We arrived here just before Christmas, slept in our new house all together on sleeping bags in the master bedroom, and wandered our neighborhood thinking,\'What the hell did we just do?\'And what have I done this year? &nbsp; Adjust, be a mom who\'s around a lot, do a few shows, write a pilot, and empty a bunch of boxes. &nbsp;The house is still not totally organized - the basement is on it\'s way... &nbsp;But I am much happier here and thrilled to be in this new family. &nbsp;It really does feel like a family. &nbsp;Mulan can barely remember life before Michael. &nbsp;Last night we talked about the drive. &nbsp;For Mulan, this was our biggest adventure of all. &nbsp;She often refers to the drive and wants to do it again - with the cat and the dog. (That part was not so much fun for me.) Anyway, as I have not taken a picture the last couple of days, I thought I\'d throw up that one of Arden, a year ago, on his way to his own new adventure here. What am I thinking about? &nbsp;Well, I am very sad about the healthcare\'overhaul.\'&nbsp;I am very sad about Obama and I am wondering if he is really who I thought he was. &nbsp;I read Robert Reich\'s and Glenn Greenwald\'s articles on Salon and I am just really so sad, and so disappointed, and I wish they would not vote for this deal and I like Howard Dean even more than I ever have and I hate Joe Leiberman, even though this demise is not all his doing. (Last night I overheard Mulan telling Michael,\'Mom was in the car driving and yelling, \'That Joe Leiberman!\' and her fists were clenched.\') Anyway, let\'s change the subject. &nbsp;What other things am I thinking about? I am thinking about all the letters I have gotten from people and how much they mean to me. I want to write back everyone, and I hope to send at least a thank you. &nbsp;I am trying to just be present and take it all in. I am thinking about some of the questions that people have asked. &nbsp;Some people worry about having meaning in a world without god in it. &nbsp;I don\'t have the best answer for that yet (I am mulling on that one) but I remember once being at a convention with
Male Yellowhammer, hatched last yearMale Goldfinch, also hatched last yearBeen ringing again, this time on our monthly visit to Beeston. It was really too windy to be very productive, but we did catch the first Yellowhammer for quite some time, an array of Greenfinches and Chaffinches, and a Goldfinch.Yesterday, we were very close to catching a Sparrowhawk, but by the time we\'d legged it to the net, it had got out and flown off.To make up for the disappointment, we caught three Long-tailed Tits. Two of them had consecutive ring numbers - they were the same two we\'d caught together at dusk the previous month! Everyone say \'ahhhhh\'...I\'ve been so busy lately that I\'ve barely had any time for photos during the week, and I haven\'t managed much at weekends either. Hopefully normal service will soon be resumed. Highlights in the garden have been up to 15 Reed Buntings and four Yellowhammers. No sign of newts in the pond yet, though there have been a few Backswimmers and Lesser Diving Beetles pootling around.photos taken with Canon EOS 30D

The World Health Organization said the Swine Flu does not appear to be spreading in a significant way. Mexican health officials have lowered its suspected death toll by 75 people, which indicates the disease is not as widespread or dangerous as originally suspected.  So far, cases of the Swine Flu outside of Mexico haven\'t been as severe. At this point 18 countries have reported outbreaks of the disease and significant measures have been taken in each to prevent further contamination.  Overall, initial concerns and predictions haven\'t been substantiated .  Originally reported by the BBC .  Scars are a part of life, but not for much longer. Scientists have discovered a drug that reduces the appearance of surgical scars.  Scaring is prevented when the compound, avotemin, is injected into the skin around a surgical incision before and after a surgery. Avotemin works to send signals between cells so the body\'s collagen knits more effectively, which reduces scars.  With more research the compound may result in an anti-scaring treatment. Even thought the drug is only cosmetic it can help people feel better about themselves - always a good thing. No one wants to be reminded of their injuries and illnesses.  Originally reported by Daily Mail.   A recent study on sperm may result in a win for everyone. Researchers discovered a gene mutation that causes infertility and the discovery may lead to  a cure. The discovery may also lead to the development of a male contraceptive pill. In just one study two issues may be a,\'ressed.  The researchers were initially trying to isolate genetic causes of deafness, but instead found two different DNA mutations in the CATSPER 1 gene that effected a man\'s ability to produce a protein related to sperm\'hyperactivity,\'or sperms ability to move fast enough to penetrate a female egg. It is possible that antibodies could be developed that could bind to the defective protein thus creating healthy, active sperm. A,\'itionally, the mutation would be selectively applied in pill form and create a male birth control pill. Both applications need more research and development. Nevertheless - there\'s hope for those who and don\'t want children.  Originally reported by the BBC .  Seeing is believing and a 73-year-old man that lost his eyesight thirty years ago can now believe - his sight is back. With the help of a bionic eye, Ron can now track light and make out basic shapes. He says he can short socks for the first time in thirty years.   Ron\'s experimental surgery took place at London\'s Moorfield\'s eye hospital. A tiny camera mounted on a pair of sunglasses transmits data via a cable to electrodes that sit upon Ron\'s retinas. When the electrodes are stimulated they transmit messages to the optic nerve in Ron\'s brain, which in turn allows him to see the light pattern experienced by the camera.  With training, patients will be able to create meaningful images based on the light patterns they can now see. To date, eighteen people have bionic eyes and more will follow.  Originally reported by the BBC.   Half a million people with severe asthma now have an effective treatment.  Two groups of researchers from the UK and Canada found injections of mepolizumab , an antibody, help reduce the frequency of severe attacks in people with asthma exacerbated. Aside from decreasing the number of attacks, the treatment also allows asthma patients to decrease their use of steroids, which have multiple negative side effects like weight gain and bone loss.  This type of asthma is linked to abnormally high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils . The antibody injections bring the white blood cell count down and that prevents the server airway inflammation associated with asthma.  The treatment reduces attacks by up to 50 percent and increases the quality of life for asthma sufferers .  Originally reported by the BBC .  Learning about endangered species is no easy task. The Saharan cheetah falls into this category and is rarely seen - until now. A team from the Zoological Society of London has captured several images of the endangered animal. The images help identify individual animals and provide information about the allusive species, which little is know about.  With fewer than 250 mature individuals in the wild, the Saharan cheetah faces extinction. By gathering images of the animals that roam just six countries (Algeria, Togo, Niger, Mali, Benin, and Burkina Faso), zoologists hope to understand the animals\' movement and ecology. This information may help save the species.  If nothing else, the images provide another face to a problem humans love to ignore - endangered species.  Originally reported by the BBC.  Photo by Farid Belbachir of the Zoological Society of London.    An allergy to peanuts is no joke. For some, just smelling peanuts can result in a fatal reaction. Which makes finding a cure all the more important and useful. A team from Cambridge\'s A,\'enbrooke\'s Hospital may have done just that. The team effectively cured four children of their peanut allergy.  Over the course of six mouths, the team gave the children larger and larger exposures to peanuts to build up their bodies\' tolerance to the nut. By the end of the six month period the children could eat five peanuts a day and have no reaction. This is the first food allergy to be mitigated by exposure.  Even though more testing needs to be done on the method, it does give people with the debilitating allergy hope. People with peanut allergies agonize over food products and often can\'t eat in certain restaurants because of the allergy.  If the allergy is curable that means improved quality of life. (It also means airlines might start serving peanuts again. Here\'s hoping.)  Originally reported by the BBC .  We\'ve all done it - forgotten to charge our phone then appealed to a friend for theirs, but of course they have a different brand of phone so their charger won\'t work. This annoying scenario will be a thing of the past.  The major phone companies - Nokia, Motorola, Samsung, Sony Ericsson, LG, T-Mobile, Orange, 3, AT&amp;T and Vodafone - have agreed to come together and create a universal phone charger that can be used with any handset model. The majority of phones will support the new charger by 2012.  A,\'itionally, the charger will be environmentally friendly and consume 50 percent less stand-by energy compared to today\'s chargers.   Let\'s give props to the major phone companies for thinking about their customers and how they can make our lives easier. It\'s also impressive that they would make the charger use less energy. Too bad the iPhone isn\'t included!  Originally reported by the BBC . 
Well, I made it to Fairbanks. It\'s a beautiful first day of spring, sunny and warm - 33 degrees. Downright tropical in this part of the world. I haven\'t been to this region of Alaska in nearly seven years; I\'m actually surprised how much of it feels familiar to me. We had a great trip up, traveling overland - the only way to travel. We took the ferry to Skagway and chugged up White Pass in my friend Bjorn\'s old Subaru (crossing our fingers the entire way). We visited friends in Whitehorse and continued north on the Alaska Highway to Kluane Lake, where we geared up for an overnight\'ski\'trip (I was on snowshoes) in the frigid mountains of the Yukon.

I realized a few weeks ago that all of my bookmark folders have, oh, tons and tons of sites marked and I can (sadly) lose track of what I actually bookmarked to enjoy. I just updated my blogroll ( now over 165 sweet blogs and sites ) with a bunch of new fab a,\'itions and wanted to share a few with you - they are lovely!! enjoy, support, love and inspire. nesting newbies :: new online lifestyle magazine run by two amazing women with a spread of food, entertaining, home design and more. and the online mag has streaming video in the articles - super creative. destined to design :: an la gal that is inspired everyday and shares it through her lovely blog. the drifter and the gypsy :: the sweet micaela\'s blog is full of design, photography and cool words. she also happens to be a recent Blog Out Loud panelist . sweet fine day :: an owner of a confectionery\'s blog?! yes! sweet, pretty and lovely photos to boot. yatzer :: my new fave innovative and eclectic\'finger on the pulse\'design mag that curates cool stuff. :: all images from their respective blogs :: last week at Blog Out Loud 5 , one of the lovely items in our goodie bags were cookies, generously donated from Sweet Ambs . ok, people, these cookies are -seriously- gorgeous!

I love the placement under the window and that it\'s a bench more then an ottoman. actually, one of my first Apartment Therapy posts was about x-inspired furniture . :: image via Good Bones, Great Spaces ::
Dear friends of Bubby, Six years ago we started a blog with our grandmother, Bubby, as a way to share her wise advice with the world. We knew that everyone would love her wit, candor and compassion. This little experiment soon turned into something more special than we could have ever imagined. Within months, Bubby was receiving letters from thousands of people around the world, pouring out their hearts, and sharing their most personal stories with our grandmother. She loved offering her help. She loved reading your letters every day. She was so proud to be a Bubby to all of you. Sadly, last night, we lost our Bubby. At 94, she was still beautiful. Thank you for all of your contributions over the years. You helped make her life that much more special. With love, the gran,\'aughters Reader Update! In July of 2006, we received a letter from a 29-year old woman with a broken heart . And this wasn\'t the first time she had to pick up the pieces. She and her fiance were supposed to be married in 2005, but he called it off and they parted ways. 6 months later he found his way back to her, begged for forgiveness, re-proposed, and she accepted. A few months went by and he called off the we,\'ing again. But of course he kept her dangling and her hopes for a third reunion remained high. When you hear a story like this, you want to yell from the rooftops,\'FORGET HIM!\'But as we all know, the heart can be hard-of-hearing sometimes. And this girl needed some advice. Leave it to Bubby to set things straight. Bubby wasted no time referring to this man as an\'immature fellow .\'She wrote,\'I recommend you forget him and if he calls, just tell him the party is over... There are many fish in the sea and I am sure there is one who is looking for you... Life with this person will never happen. I wish you all the happiness in the world.\'Even an anonymous commenter left a note saying:\'Bubby\'s quite right. If he breaks it off once, and comes back, and all\'s well, fine. We all make mistakes, and we all have doubts. If he breaks it off twice?! Run, and never look back.\'There is nothing we love more at this website than an update letter with a happy ending. So we are pleased to report that nearly 3 years to the date of this original posting, we heard from this woman again. What do you think happened? Did he finally grow a pair? Did she learn her lesson? Did she take Bubby\'s advice?\'Read on to find out... Dear Bubby, I wanted to write to up-date you and to thank you for the very good advice you gave me some three years ago now. My then fiance had called off our we,\'ing for the second time and I was so distressed. You said I should forget this immature person who had wasted so much of my time. I took your advice and it really really worked out! After deciding to end all contact with my ex-fiance, I worked hard on my career and found a fantastic new job. The very first month I met a colleague in another department and, in time, we fell in love. We married last year and are now expecting our first child. With my ex, everything was difficult. With my now husband, everything is easy - we can really talk and he is so kind, fun and gentle. And, he was, from the beginning, absolutely sure about me. He is also supportive of my career as we work in the same field, something my ex never was. Really, he just cares deeply about my happiness and I couldn\'t imagine that I could ever love someone as much as I love him. I never would have found this wonderful man if I hadn\'t taken your advice. Anyway, just to thank you. Writing to you and receiving your sensible response was a great comfort to me then, and I am so grateful I listened to your wisdom. Wishing you and your family every happiness, No longer \'Heart-broken all over again.\' Thank you!! xo, the gran,\'aughters and Happy Passover! Searching for the afikomen Can be quite a chore Tipsy from the wine you drank Glasses, 1 to 4. Filling up on matzah brie Children ask,\'On this night, why...?\'What better way to celebrate Than to have Bubby make your seder plate. April 17, 2005: A Bubby\'s Passover wish for everyone April 24, 2005: 32 people around the table! April 25, 2005: Noodle Yummy on Passover? June 22, 2005: Why 8 days? Passover cartoons: Here. love, the gran,\'aughters Happy Birthday! No, not to Bubby. One of her gran,\'aughters is turning 31 this week! We\'ll be visiting Bubby over the weekend to celebrate with her. Plus, rumor is we\'re going to be baking hamentashins with her too. Now that\'s what Bubby calls a party. (By the way, if you need the recipe again, here it is . And here\'s the baking video we made last year.) But, back to the aging process. Here are some great birthday-themed letters that have been sent to Bubby over the years: Is it approrpriate to have a Jewish baby naming ceremony for a boy on his first birthday ? Why did he act so distant at my birthday party even though he drove 2 hours to see me? Bubby thinks you should take a cold shower and wait until your 16th birthday party. My husband forgot my birthday , what should I do? If I pretend you are my Bubby, will you send me a birthday gift? Why don\'t you buy him a nice broadcloth shirt or a slipover sweater for his birthday ? My boyfriend had fun on his 21st birthday , but I haven\'t yet. Should I marry him? Best to everyone! What an historic day! Bubby couldn\'t be more pleased to see Barack Obama become our new president. She was glued to CNN just like the rest of the world. Can you imagine how it must feel to be 93 and see such a pivotal moment in history?? To commemorate the day, we decided to remind you of some great letters Bubby has responded to over the years that were related to politics. Bubby reflects on Bush Bush talks to the CIA How to become President of your company How to become Vice President of your company Reflections on Reagan\'s funeral ceremony love, the gran,\'aughters With the economy being what it is today, and stock markets holding your dreams at bay, your financial woes may make you shed a tear, and overdose on panic and fear. But Bubby just smiles and to us she\'ll say,\'Don\'t forget. Money is round... It can roll towards you, or away.\'Here are some of the best\'money questions\'Bubby has responded to over the years. How can I retire and still take care of everyone? I\'m 13 and I really, really need a job If I stayed in India I would have no money problems! My husband is so stressed about our finances I want to make more money before I propose My best friend just won a million dollars I have 7 kids to support but I hate my job love, the gran,\'aughters Another year has gone by... Another birthday is here to celebrate. HAPPY 93 rd BUBBY! love, everyone Post your birthday wishes to Bubby in the comments below. Happy Rosh Hashana! Bubby and her gran,\'aughters wish all of you a happy and healthy new year. Over the years we have received so many (thousands!) of touching, endearing, tearful, hopeful, soulful letters from people around the world, asking Bubby for life advice. We wish for all of you that your stories turn out happy and everyone sees all their dreams come true. And on that note, how \'bout a happy update letter ! On July 25, 2005 , we received a letter from a 25-year old woman living in Belgium who told Bubby she was planning to marry her boyfriend. She was looking for her first job after graduate school, but the only one available to her was far away in Paris. She wasn\'t excited about the job and didn\'t feel like it matched her qualifications. But she was afraid her parents would be mad if she didn\'t accept it. Bubby wrote her wisely,\'It is a terrible feeling to get up in the morning and go to a job that you don\'t like or are not qualified for. Just give yourself more time to find the job for which you are trained and you are qualified.\'And then she a,\'e,\',\'on\'t worry about your boyfriend. If you really love one another distance will not make a difference.\'Bubby knows what long-distance love is like ! And she knew there was a way to solve this problem if everyone sat down to talk about it.\'Put your thinking cap on!\'Bubby told her. A few years went by, and on March 8, 2006 , we received a great update letter. They were still happily in love and getting married! She did find another job that she was much happier with, even though it still meant geographical distance for the couple. But they visited each other every weekend, and spoke on the phone every day. She wrote,\'This is working, because we made it work, with lots of patience and love. Thanks for your nice advice to me when I asked for it... I\'ll send you another update for the we,\'ing.\'Well, we\'re happy to report that she kept her word. This week we received another great update letter. She wrote: Dear Bubby, I am very happy to tell you that, due to my good job and good fortune, he was able to come join me in Paris to look for a job (which he found easily). We got married in April. We first met in 2003, and it was a difficult 5 years. We got through it, partly thanks to your advice. So thank you very much and take care. From, The Old Continent
Happy New Year everybody! What an incredible year 2009 was. It was such a great journey and I have met so many wonderful and talented people along the way. Thank you to everyone who has participated in my portrait project here. It was such an honor to have spent time with you and to take your portrait. I am so lucky to have had the chance to meet people from all over. I know some of you thought I should make myself the last portrait but I had already shot myself earlier this year. Take a scroll back and find me! But the main reason I chose not to make myself the last portrait was because I wanted to be surprised. I didn\'t want to plan or think about that too much. I also knew that it would be hard to choose one person so shooting a family seemed to be a great way to end the project. I have been going back and forth with whether or not I should continue the project in 2010 and I have also decided not to continue L\'image Quotidienne in this new year. I am sorry if I am disappointing anyone but this project was to be for one year and although it would be great to continue on, indefinitely for that matter, there are some other projects that I would like to work on. I know I won\'t be able to completely stop shooting portraits of random people I see on the street but please look for those posts on my M Photo blog . Thank you everyone for your kind comments and support. I am so grateful. But before I say goodbye I wanted to leave you all with two last portraits. They are the same ladies I shot at the beginning of this blog. What a difference a year makes! And please don\'t forget to check out what my December portraits are into. Super cool stuff people! Thanks again and all the best in 2010!!

Here are two things I never expected to happen: one, the most amazing, is to find my name on a Forbes list . Not the one headed by Oprah, but deeply exciting all the same; I can now paraphrase all those Oscar winners and say how honoured I am to be named alongside such talent, etc, etc. The second thing is that yesterday¥s pressure cooker rice was excellent. Call it risotto or call it arroz caldoso, it was just unbeleivable, as in, hard to beleive: creamy, perfectly cooked rice, full of flavour, in less than fifteen minutes from the minute I turned on the hob to sitting down? I was deeply sceptical, but figured it worth a try, and so it was. Risotto, long banished from my kitchen except as an occasional treat, comes back as a weeknight dinner staple. The rice cooker reigns supreme for white rice and for truly hands off restful cooking, but for quick and incredibly delicious results, this is the one. Here is what I did yesterday with what I had, but of course onions can take the place of leeks, chorizo for bacon if you¥re so inclined, any other vetetable for the peas, and aromatics can vary: saffron, herbs, etc. Pressure cooker arroz caldoso, or risotto adapted from Lorna Sass Sautee two chopped leeks and bacon until the bacon releases its fat and the leeks begin to look floppy. Deglaze with some white wine, let it bubble up and a,\' 1 1/2 cups short grain rice. Stir, a,\' 3 1/2 cups of stock and cover the pressure cooker. Let it come uo to high pressure and count five minutes (five!!! seriously, aren¥t you in love already?). Now release the pressure and have a look. You might want a bit more broth, or you might want to let some of it evaporate. I thought it was just fine with those meassures. A,\' butter and parmesan and there you are, risotto for three hungry people or four staid ones. I¥m a gadget-driven cook. It¥s all very well to extoll the virtues of unplugged cooking, and wax lyrical about pesto lovingly made in a pestle and mortar, but for day to day food-on-the-table purposes, I¥d be lost without a Thermomix, a rice cooker, a blender and a radio.  I thought a slow cooker might be a good thing, since my favourite stews are off the radar. The idea of leaving an oven on for hours in the vicinity of a danger-seeking to,\'ler makes me pale. Plus, with two children in the world I¥m beginning to feel guilty about our fuel consumption. But slow cookers are hard to come by in Spain, and I have had a pressure cooker sitting in a cupboard since I got married almost six years ago, so yesterday I had my pressure baptism. Chickpeas in minutes convinced me in seconds, and I¥ve been playing with it ever since. My first solo flight was based on this rag ˘ . I did¥t lock the pressure valve properly, and scorched the bottom, but all the same, I had a really tasty chunky sauce that¥s made a great filling for empanada . So far, so good. The chicken stock is what has me lost in wonder. I was convinced it would come out cloudy, but tried it anyway, thinking P \' a wouldn¥t mind. But amazingly, in 45 minutes I had a pot of golden, beautiful, clear broth. I did skim it before locking the lid, mind you, but it didn¥t take so long. So now, instead of making a giant 5 litre batch of stock every month or so, I¥ll make a amaller 2 litre batch all the time. It¥s magic! I have a chunk of pork shoulder marinating even as we speak, waiting to be turned into melt-in-the-mouth shreds of aromatic meat for tomorrow¥s lunch. I¥ve only been using the pressure cooking for 24 hours, so maybe it¥s just a coup de foudre and I¥ll drop it in a week. But I don¥t think so. I think I¥ll be making a lot more beans and curries and stews, and can¥t wait for Lorna Sass¥ book to arrive. In the meantime, it¥s risotto tonigth with this morning¥s chicken stock. And if that works, well, then I can see myself becoming the official pressure cooker bore, as well as the official rice cooker bore. After months of bot being allowed to eat rare red meat, I¥m craving a burger bigtime. But I think burgers are best left to professionals, and are best had in greasy, smoky places, and I¥m not about to take my precious new baby there, yet, lest he come back smeared with ketchup. A good home alternative? A Pepito. Ask for a pepito anywhere in Spain and you will be given a steak sandwich. If you¥re lucky, it will be a thin, juicy paillard type thing, and the oil and meat juices will soak into good, crunchy bread. If you¥re not , which is more often the case, you will receive a slab of grey cardboard hunkering between two slabs of nothing bread. This is sad. This is not the sort of sandwich one wants as the namesake for a son and heir. It is a sad testament to the terrible lack of imagination most of Spain gives it sandwiches. To my mind, a proper pepito should have something sharp, like mustard or horseradish. Something crunchy, like cornichons. Greens, like ruccola. Butter, if J isn¥t looking. And some slippery onions, either just made, or in the lovely form of onion jam . As for the meat, I favour a thick steak, salted, then marinated overnight in whatever¥s around. This time it was olive oil, two smashed cloves of garlic, a sprinkling of thyme, a splash of sherry and some fish sauce, but anything goes. Sear it so it¥s black outside and pink within, let it rest while you assemble the sandwiches on a good fresh baguette, and open a couple of beers. Slice the meat thin, and sneak a few slices as you put it inside the bread. You¥ll have to agree that this is a beautiful thing, and I for one would be more than glad to share a name with it. Here¥s a very good reason to stop the rather infrequent postings on this blog: Pepe, two weeks old today. He was born three weeks early and so overset all my plans to stock my freezer, get a haircut and write a few posts to have as backup. It¥s a pretty blissful life; sure I don¥t sleep much at night, but thanks to J and my family I¥m allowed to take naps at o,\' times, eat all sorts of delicious things practically nonstop and enjoy my beautiful babies. My chicken guy at the market is a very sweet fellow who doesn¥t mind selling me only half a chicken. Free range chickens are so big that even half is over a kilo, and that¥s a lot of chicken for me. Not that I dislike chicken, but I do find it hard to be fascinated by it. However, stomach flu being what it is, and my baby being now in the grip of it, chicken breast must be gently poached . So my half of a big chicken gives me one big breast half, skin off, that the butcher cuts out. The thigh and the drumstick. A wing. A piece of backbone, and the neck. Wing, neck and bone go into the freezer for the making of stock whenever my storage runs low. The other two pieces I roasted today following the method called by la Lawson\'one-pan chicken\'. It results in roast chicken that is quite ok, but that I am happy to leave for a sandwich or pot pie some other day. The star of the show for me are the vegetables; potatoes, onions and carrots that soak up the chicken juices and the fat, char and burn and turn crispy or melting and are just the best thing ever. This time, I spooned yogurt over them and it was quite a revelation. I¥ve been down a couple of days with the stomach flu that¥s going around. Whenever I¥ve had stomach trouble, always the get-better food has been the same. The first day one is allowed nothing but lemon water, with sugar and maybe a little salt. Then plain white rice, perhaps some dry toast, tea, if you¥re looking good, and a little boiled chicken. Next day you might progress to boiled ham, and chicken broth, or yogurt with a little stwed apple. You know that you¥re definitely getting better when you¥re allowed boiled potatoes, in their skins. These come with a thin trickle of olive oil and some crunchy salt, and they are the most delicious thing in the world. Not just because you know that you will soon be back to normal, but because after some days of eating really dull stuff your palate is clean, your senses are sharp and you are reminded of just how great very simple things can taste. Luckily for me, it¥s come just in time to feel pleasantly detoxed and mammothly hungry for my mother¥s birthday today. This is going to be a lazy post, by which I mean, I am not going to write up a recipe. The reason? Ethnic. I don¥t feel I can speak with any authority or knowledge about Asian soups. I was born and have always lived in a country that used to have no immigrants, where all Chinese restaurants were called\'La gran muralla\'. They served fried rice and gloopy lemon chicken and if anybody ever asked for a soup there I¥ve never met them. Now things have improved, and it¥s possible to have pretty good stuff, at least in Madrid. Most importantly, it¥s possible to buy lots of ingredients that allow you to replicate many of the lovely things found in books and around the internet. And that¥s what the beauty of my lack of Asian food education comes in; my standards are so low that I just looove what I make. The fun bit with all these things is stocking up the pantry. A trip to the Mostenses market and its adjacent shops will have you coming back with bulging bags for very little money. I buy noodles, won ton wrappers, dried shiitakes, fish sauce, chili garlic sauce, Hoisin sauce, big bottles of soy sauce, sesame oil, bean sprouts, good cheap chicken, massive ginger roots, even chinese chives and bok choi and pak choy. It¥s a lot of fun. You can even brave the underworld and try to eat at the subterranean restaurant in the Plaza de EspaÒa parking lot, which is always packed and so rather difficult. I hear it¥s great, and hope some day to put it to the test. Meanwhile, I¥ll be trying to make won tons, and making lots and lots of soup. What kind? Well, on lazy days it might be instant miso soup. On more energetic ones good chicken stock with fish sauce, a hint of chili and some mint or chives. And for true soul warming stuff, filling yet light, the full on chicken noodle treatment, or a version thereof with scraps of leftover roast meat. It¥s a very accomodating patron, the noodle soup, and one that always hits the spot, so have a go. Here¥s Gasparini , a blog I¥ve been meaning to link to for ages. It has the most drop dead gourgeous meringues, and shares the recipes, which is lovely of course. Not that I could ever make anything so pretty, ever, at any time, but isn¥t it lovely to see it? I have contributed to the all around prettiness, I like to think, in the blog header and the logos, so go have a look.
One of the fun things about preparing admission files for review is looking at the names of the recommenders. By this time I am familiar with the applicants\' names, but now as I check to see if each student has three letters of recommendation, I am struck by the variety - and funny - names of the numerous recommenders.
Once again, our band of\'Heroes,\'and I put that in quotes since the increasingly dislikable James remains part of the tribe, ran up against the dreaded\'P-word\'at this week\'s Immunity Challenge - puzzle. It\'s really no surprise the Villain braintrust is dominating challenges when it comes to using the ole\' noggin.  What is alarming is Heroes leader, J.T\'s decision to oust one of the tribe\'s most intelligent players, Tom, in favor of James with his bad leg and equally bad mojo. Clearly, our Heroes are in bad shape, both physically and mentally.  But a nasty storm is quickly moving in over at the Villains camp, as Russell prepares to rain down hell on Rob.
The first time I saw One Night With The King was on January 1 2008 and I loved it.  The movie is about the story of Esther and how she became queen.  The set, the actors, the actresses... everything was very beautiful and I couldn\'t wait for the DVD to come out so I could watch it again.  And when the DVD came out, I did watch it.  Over and over and over again.
Things have been crazy. I\'ve been of course working on my 365days project but a new distraction has come up. The Sims 3. I\'m re-a,\'icted to this game. In fact right after I post this I\'m going to play it. But it\'s fine because my homework is done, room semi-clean, and chores have been complete. Now I\'m off! Goodbye for now!
I\'ve had a lot on my mind these past few days. And so I haven\'t spent much time actually blogging about my relationship with Birdie and/or Kelley. To be honest, it\'s all just a little bit confusing to me at the moment. I like what we\'ve done so far, but for some reason I\'m ambivalent about moving forward.
The Townehouse was the most packed I\'d ever seen. It\'s been a while since I stood in a crowd in front of a stage, pressed up against strangers, unable to even see the performers on stage.I never knew foosball was such fun and so hilarious. We were shrieking and laughing a LOT. I like how when we get together the snacks are always amazing, and sometimes we inject each other with sterile water (some have obviously been acquiring new skills). We sure know how to have a good time.
I borrowed this dress from my roommate. It is typical American Apparel, which means it is pretty comfortable and looks good. It\'s perfect for those mornings when I have to rush to my 8AM class. I got this shirt about two years ago at a thrift store. It is the perfect shirt for spring. Today was the first warm day since I\'ve been back in Vermont. Spring is certainly on it\'s way.
We\'ve been on 2 Disney Cruises and going on our 3rd next month.  They are just great.  There is always so much to do or you can do nothing.    I like the \'doing nothing\' part.  I go and sit at Quiet Cove Pool-the adults only pool-with a drink with an umbrella in my hand and bask in the sun.  There is nothing better than that.   All the cast members are so great and helpful.  Room service is great too!!!!  It\'s just so nice to sit in your room or on your verandah and eat while watching the ocean sail away.  We always have a catagory 7 state room so we have a verandah.
n June my husband and I took a trip through the Grand Tetons National Park and to Yellowstone National Park. My husband had always wanted to go there, and while I was fine with our destination, I wasn\'t necessarily all that excited about it. What a blessing it was to go there! I was absolutely amazed and awestruck by the beauty and grandeur of these parks. We stayed in West Yellowstone Montana at the Holiday Inn Sunspree Resort while we toured Yellowstone. It was wonderful.
jet blue is by far the best airlines i have ever taken i have travel many other but with the rising cost of air-fair i traveled to fl from Boston for only 100 and was hooked they even serve  my favorite coffee dunk-ins while you kick back and watch TV or movies how much better can it get for 100 bucks please tell me if you can beat that lol thanks Jeannie
I love Continental Airlines! They never disappoint me and I am so thrilled with their service. I travel a lot and I just have thumbs up for this outstanding airline. I recommend all travelers to go through Continental Airlines. They have great employees that are so professional and so caring for us travelers. I feel special and great traveling all the time through them. If I would use another airline, it would be because I am forced to if Continental Airlines didn\'t take me to my destination. There are many different ways to earn mileage in this airlines.
Ginger, my daughter-in-law, just sent me this photo of my grandbabies...Ben and Charlie. Ben is a bit over 3 years and Charlie\'s 7 months old. My cousin saw this photo...wrote me telling me it would be a good advertisement for Cosco! Aren\'t they so cute and sweet...it\'s about time for me to go for another visit!
First off, Dw went as part of a leadership team from our denomination to assess how exactly to plant an orphanage(s). He was told before he left, that they knew that Dw\'s appointment was a divine assignment because of all the orphanages he has been part of, volunteered at, and supported. They also loved that we have adopted 7 kids ourselves. {I love that part too
Sebryna has learned that when she does something naughty, my response is usually\'Noooo!\'. Now I know when she has been naughty without even looking at her because she says it herself,\'Mommy, Nooooooooo!.\'....only it\'s much cuter because she makes her voice very dramatic with a nasally sound. (Imagine someone yelling,\'Hellooooooo in therrrrre\'like they\'re calling into a cave). SO CUTE!!
This company is great.  Its a new company but its stock will truly show just how much.  They have reached some high profit numbers.  Soon to be again, and steady! I look for Metro to become more diverse and expect them to take on a nice share of the cellular market from the\'big guys\'and make it more affordable to all.
I just found a beautiful little book of quotes called\'Words of the Spirit, thoughts to live by\'they are compiled from discourses from Para Pujya Ma. I am here in Kathmandu and have brought my camera, though unfortunately, I am unable to use my USB port and have no card reader, so I will have to paint the pictures with my words for now.
God spoke to my heart today. I have been in a season of change. It is much needed changed but it wasn\'t change I had control over which made me uncomfortable. So for the last 47 days of my life I have been seeking clarity and direction in my life. I have gone through so many different emotions and have questioned God over and over again. I prayed and prayed but weeks have gone by and nothing. Nothing has changed in my situation. My days are long and unproductive. I have been completely unmotivated to do anything but the absolutely necessary.
So this morning I came in early to try to get some work done. But some of my colleagues had the same thoughts and came in as soon as I got my door open. Sigh. Then my internet did not seem to want to work. Sigh. And my email was not responding. Sigh. But now, as you can see, everything is back to normal, including the time.
he MAC mini has been a great replacement server for my old Windows 2003 box.  It performs like a champ and with little to no maintenance.  I\'ve had it running for over a year now (on 24/7 hosting several websites) and I have not had any problems.  I Upgraded the Ram to 2 gig and other than that I haven\'t done a thing to it.  I use a regular\'pc\'mouse, a mac wireless keyboard and a sony monitor.  It is the only server on my network of 2 laptops and 2 PC\'s.  I couldn\'t be happier with it and can\'t wait to upgrade to Leopard!
Out of all the contact lens solutions available, Clear Care by Ciba Vision does the best job at keeping my contact lenses clean and comfortable.  It\'s a hydrogen peroxide solution and really helps to remove any debris or deposits on my lenses.  Because my contacts are the kind that are replaced quarterly, it definitely helps keep my lenses feeling fresh even towards the time when I need to replace them.  You do have to be careful though.  It\'s not for rinsing your contacts and you can\'t put it in your eyes or you\'ll burn them.
Dr. Mike examined me after I had been to 10 MDs. These 10 others couldn\'t diagnose my illness and didn\'t seem to care. Dr. Mike could tell there was something really wrong and didn\'t want to treat me, but gave me some great advice as far as treatment I should receive. I followed that advice and am now being treated by a tremendous and brilliant MD--one outside the system I had been in. I appreciate his care, concern, and professional advice. I\'m doing much better now.
SO I TOTALLY DID THE PRESCRIBED WEIGHT FOR WOMEN OF 95#s!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am really proud of me. Like really, really really. It was tough. By round 5 I was mentally drained; I couldn\'t believe that I had 5 more rounds to do. What did I eat today? Not much. I had Scrambled eggs with Parmesan cheese, bacon, and basil. A decaf latte.
Our family of 4 really enjoyed our cruise on Disney Cruise Line\'s Wonder ship.  Even though we went off-season and it rained almost every day, it was a vacation we\'ll never forget.  The food was amazing and we felt like royalty every time we dined.  The shows were awesome, especially for our kids who had never seen a live theatre production before.  They also have very secure child care facilities that the kids just loved!  They thought we were dropping them off to have some parent-free fun, not the other way around!
I have to say that I really did love this bike, I owned one from 2002 to 2005!  Easy to handle and comfortable, with enough power to get me up the grades to Mammoth!People thought I was riding a harley, lol.. I was so grateful that  paid a fraction of what it would have cost me for a harley.Great gas mileage, I rode it everywhere! with the weather in Ca. and this bike. Oh My, I was in heaven!
After completing the tie I undertook the task of making 2 to,\'ler ties for my sister-in-law Tiara\'s we,\'ing. I took apart a Men\'s Tie and was able to make 2 to,\'ler ties. I think I could even make one bitty baby tie with the left over. Anyway, I took apart one of Davis\' ties to use as a pattern. It was really easy. I may make a pattern.
Last week my girl\'s & I found out some very sad news. A cat friend of ours passed away. Lou was my parent\'s pet & the girl\'s begged to take him home every time we visited. Lou got very sick & had to be\'put to sleep\'. Last week my girl\'s & I found out some very sad news. A cat friend of ours passed away.

When i got off the plan in aruba i knew it was a different place from the others we had been to in the carribean.  aruba has a constant breeze which makes the warm but not too warm weather even nicer!  the water was beautifully calm and gorgeously blue.  the food was good too!  my husband and i burn easily and yet left after a week in aruba with out a red mark on us!!
Wasn\'t sure whether we\'d have a good experience after all the things I\'d read in reviews about Enterprise, but we got to the small regional airport late in the day on a Thursday afternoon.  The compact we had reserved was gone and so we were upgraded to a Nissan Murano, a nice SUV (horrible gas mileage, though).The manager (only one person doing all the tasks) didn\'t write down a large scratch on the left rear bumper, and I made my husband go back in and have her identify it on her copy.
I have flown JetBlue many times and I have never had a bad experience.  I am a very frequent flyer, taking 100 or more domestic and international airlines trip a year, and I have flown most of the world\'s airlines, and I have to give JetBlue my personal award for being number one, the best. At least in coach.  I\'m not saying that another airline\'s First Class or Business Class is not better (although I have flown afew where JetBlue\'s is superior to their premium service.  But in general I\'m only comparing coach to coach, and the general day to day operations of the airline.
Kathmandu, has changed very little since my last visit except that things are slightly more expensive and there is even less electricity and more garbage. People seem to have given up on the idea that government will be solving their problems any time soon. As a result, there are more electric generators at shops and restaurants.
If you\'re in the market for a new point-and-shoot digital camera, you don\'t have to spend an arm and a leg for a product that produces quality photos. According to Wendy Sheehan Donnell, PCMag\'s managing editor for consumer electronics, if you\'re looking for a new digital camera, it\'s a great time to find a deal as vendors make room for newer models.Sheehan Donnell rounded up Eight Great Digital Cameras for Under $200. For example, you can save 40 percent off of the Canon PowerShot SD960 IS. Originally $329.99, the camera is on sale for $199.99 at BestBuy.com. The camera has a 16:9 LCD, which lets you frame your shots to match the format of HDTV and widescreen laptop displays. Read the full review at PCMag.com.
When I travel, I always try to find a Continental flight because I know that most of their flights are on-time and reliable.  I also find their seats to be a little roomier.  I recently flew American Airlines because it was more convenient, but was surprised at how CRAMPED the seats were!  In an airplane, when traveling with a lap child (child under 2 traveling on my lap for free), every inch of space counts -- big time!  We are very nearly always treated courtesly, although some of the flight attendants seem to be getting a little bit of an attitude, like\'we\'re better and we know it\'.
Many people fear the holidays because they are afraid of putting on a few extra pounds. Some even turn down party and dinner invitations in hopes of avoiding any new bulges or rolls. However, holidays are the perfect time to touch base with family members and friends that you don\'t see regularly throughout the year, so it is important not to let fears of gaining weight prevent you from having some holiday fun.
It is progress! If possible, I would like to visit the school when I go to Nepal in March and make a contribution to their operating expenses. I would also like to arrange a letter exchange with some of our local school students. But, I will have to wait and see how the plan unfolds. Travel restrictions, strikes, and weather can make it difficult to get to rural areas of Nepal, and someone would have to offer to host me in their home. With only a two week travel plan, I may not be able to get there and back. If I do get there, I\'ll bring you pictures and stories.  In February, I will be giving a free lecture on \'Life and work in Nepal during difficult times.\' I will discuss the effects of 911 on Nepal, the murder of the entire Nepalese Royal family, endless annual strikes, and the Maoist Revolution. The lecture will be held at the Plymouth UCC in Shaker Heights, OH. Sunday February 14th, 9:30 - 10:20 am in room 102.
I want to run. To live. To live, every day. To see the world as full of beauty as it is. I don\'t want to surround myself with people who wonder why they exist. Who can\'t see the beauty; who don\'t see the purpose of it. I want to feel like dancing at my memories, dancing for my future, dancing in the moment. I want to giggle when I have no explanation for why.
The Mughals had a dress code and would not wear the pant/shirt cause mostly non-believers would wear them. However, now a days even our so-called Islamically established states have the concept of the western pant/shirt deeply engraved in their societies. So what now? What do our youth do? A solution can be to take these western concepts and\'Islamisize\'them. A good example would be clothing. Take the western pant/shirt and make them longer, and looser.  As Muslims we should look decent and healthily smart, not overly dressed to the extreme. And Muslims we should not lose our identity in the process.
evlon challenges its customers to \'Get Cheeky\' with their new Pinch Me Sheer Gel Blush. Being the makeup junkie that I am, I rose to the challenge and decided to give this new product a try. I did hesitate for a brief minute since I\'d never heard anything positive about blush gels, but ultimately I decided to jump on in. I\'m glad that I did!
The husband finished his breakfast and refused to take mom to the bank or walk Lucky when asked. Mum won\'t drive with me and would rather cancel her plans instead, which she did. As I was beginning to log out, What A Girl Wants was playing on TV and it was too tempting to let pass but I had to. I had things to get done. The husband went to sleep and refused to move, no matter how many times I called him. Annoyed and needing a break, I sat down to watch the movie.
It\'s our 20th episode and to help us celebrate, UGO\'s man about town, Parker Ward, dropped in to discuss the current holy TV trinity of Idol, Lost and the Olympics.  Are Simon and Ellen really mortal enemies or is their\'feud\'just another lame publicity stunt?  Does Survivor really suck?  Is Hoarders the best thing since Intervention?  And when will Claire quite yammering about her\'bay-bay?\'All this and more answered to the best our ability on this week\'s cast!  Let us know your thoughts on these matter in our Facebook group and keep Toob Tied on constant rotation by subscribing to us on iTunes!
AND. My hair!? Something really weird is happening to my hair! I can\'t seem to find a shampoo and conditioner that doesn\'t leave my hair grimy and gross. In the last couple of weeks every shampoo and conditioner I have used makes my hair feel like it has a terrible build up.
I love this show! Unfortunately, I didn\'t watch it when the it was on during it\'s regular season, because I didn\'t think it would be any good. I happened upon a rerun of it one day, and fell in love.It is one of the funniest shows on TV! My husband I TiVo every episode and watch them back to back! I cannot understand WHY it was canceled!? It is so entertaining and funny. I love Jason Bateman!!! And Portia De Rossi is so beautiful!
In a medium saucepan combine chicken broth, water, onion, brown rice, red pepper, and garlic.  Bring to boiling; reduce heat.  Simmer, covered, for 20 minutes.  Stir in lentils.

My last three flights booked on JetBlue were all cancelled. Without notice. Without warning. No phone call. No email. It has been extremely frustrating. While I know flight cancellations happen, I do expect to be notified so I don\'t get all the way to the airport before I find out!
I use all of hylands products! I love the arnica and any time someone is hurt I give it to them. I also love the fact that it is safer than name brand products you see in the store. About four years ago my daughter fell and hit a sprinkler so hard that it snapped in half. My parents were going to give her tylenol and I said NO!! The bruise was about four inches all the way around. I had my mom give her arnica tablets three times a day and then apply arnica cream to the bruise in the morning and then again at night.
Obesity is a rising problem in western societies. In the UK, according to NHS Statistics (published in Feb 2009) for the year 2007, 24% of adults (ie those over 16) were classified as obese, an increase of 15% from 1993, and 37% of adults had a raised waist circumference (over 88cm for women and 102cm for men) compared to 23% in 1993. It is estimated that in America, at any given time, about two-thirds of the population (at a ratio of two women for every man) are on a diet (ref: Centre for Disease Control and Prevention), with only 5% successful at keeping off the weight lost.
I had LapBand surgery almost 2 years ago, and I have lost 80 pounds and kept it off with ease! It was the most amazing procedure and I love my band, and I have a totally new life now because of it! I have two young boys and I can run and keep up with them now.
ve done a lot of research when it comes to dog food. I am not a dog owner that buys my dog cheap food that has potential to cause a lot of allergies. California Natural is one of the best, top of the line dog food you can buy. My dogs have the softest coats. I am a Doberman owner and I do not cheap out on my \'babies\'. That being said, a large bag is close to $45-50 in Michigan. Furthermore, I have to drive about 25 miles to get a bag because the local pet stores (Petsmart, Petco) do not sell this line.
My uncle for one will vouch for banning me from AlMaghrib, yes, this isn\'t the first time Sammo has decided she HAS HAS HAS to go to an AlMaghrib class and tell him that it would be advisable to come another weekend, that is if him and the family decide to pay us a visit (which they probably will). I love my family and relatives and they have and always will be priority, but AlMaghrib is my life now and sometimes its hard to decide between the two loves of my life.
Wow, the US is gorgeous.....and big!  I just got back from a five day trip to Yellowstone National Park and The Grand Tetons with my 13 year old nephew.  What a fantastic trip! It is like bringing your 7th grade science class with you on tour.I generally knew what a Geyser was, but, well not exactly.  And the difference between a Geyser and a Hot Spring or Boiling Mud Pot?  No, not at all.  With land spontaneously spitting out steam and mud bubbles, you can see why a 13 year old boy had a fabulous time.
My husband and I love watching\'Arrested Development\'on DVD.  We need to buy the series already!!  We have rented the entire 3 seasons from Netflix too many times to count.  What I really want to know is who made the decision to take this series off the air?  I mean seriously, are they still employed at Fox or what?  I would love to hear your comments if you know the answer or even want to rant.
his straightener is okay, when I first got it I was so excited, it worked great but I was noticing that after awhile it didn\'t work as good. It\'s been 5 months now and when I put it on a lower temperature it automatically turns off, and the plate covering is all chipped off. So basically I am going to have to buy another straightener due to I can\'t use this one anymore or it will chip even more. If you are planning on buying this product, I highly recommend you take extra good care of it or it will definitely break soon enough. I am going give the sedu a shot!
Although I should be doing 100 other things, I just want to write and say how happy I am and how blessed I feel. I think I have the greatest kids in the whole wide world. They are really great! They try so hard to be good. Thobe had an assignment the other day to fill out a star that sai,\'dI am special because...\'and Thobe wrote,\'I am special because I am good.\'I hung that next to my phone. Whenever I see it I think,\'He is good. All my boys are just so good.\'I love them so much.
Cargo Plantlove eyeshadow ($20, Sephora) is proof that \'green\' beauty is not merely eco-chic. It\'s eco-fabulous.Even if I didn\'t know that this eyeshadow was organic, I really wouldn\'t care. Plantlove eyeshadow is, for the most part, silky, deeply pigmented and highly blendable.My top pick out of the collection is Dove, a sexy and utterly wearable shade of neutral deep blue gray that performs beautifully as both an understated liner by day and a dramatic, lid-to-crease, smoked-out eyeshadow by night.
Eating 5 fruit and vegetables a day. Fortunately, the shops are helping us to achieve that goal. But don\'t think just 5 fruit and no vegetables is enough; a new study by Rush University Medical center in Chicago has concluded that eating 2+ vegetable a day can help slow down mental decline due to ageing. Those people who ate 2.8 servings of vegetables almost halved their rate of memory decline compared to people who ate less than 1 serving a day. According to the study, it is not too late to start, as older people who started the 2+ veg a day still showed significant delay in mental decline.
I often compare Backbreaker, weirdly, not to other football games, because we feel it\'s so different. The game that comes to mind for me is Burnout. Burnout\'s a driving game, but you don\'t need to be an expert driver to have fun with that. Because even if you fail in Burnout, you fail spectacularly and it looks cool and it feels good. Even when you\'ve just smashed your car up, it looks really cool.
Last Saturday we went to a so called Gypsy Fair, which was more market for weird stuff then actual fair. But the \'house trucks\' were interesting to look at. If you imagine an old gypsy wagon then transpose it onto an older style truck you kind of can imagine what they were like. But overall it was rather disappointing, as much is becoming here.  Like Greg\'s aspirations for work. For weeks he diligently prepped his resume, reviewed immigration information and made profiles on various job search websites. But often when he went back to those websites he couldn\'t use his log in information and so emailed the websites for assistance.
his is the only food I have purchased for my bully since he was ten months old. It was highly recommended in my online bully groups; so thought I would try it. And I have never been disappointed for a minute! I have noticed how much easier it is for my dog to eat this than the puppy food he was on; as well as the fact that his flatulence is now virtually non-existant. I can\'t vouch for the flavor as my dog will eat anything; but I do believe in this product! I buy mine at Petco; and a bag at a cost of approximately $35 will last me about a month; and every tenth bag is free!
I\'ve made my very first Mosaic picture, and it\'s all thanks to Mary over at Little Red House and the tutorial that she made! I do also want to thank Brenda over Cozy Little House for giving me that info! Thank you both so much! Seeing how much I loveeee pictures I know what I\'m going to be doing alot of. Please don\'t forget to stop in at Mary\'s blog Little Red House, she\'s the hostess of Mosaic Monday and there you\'ll be able to view every ones beautiful mosaic pictures, maybe even enter yourself! So until the next time...Bead Happy! Hugs and happy beading...
My charts are becoming real pieces of art these days.  My most recent work is the Gumball Chart, inspired by Chase\'s deep desire for a gumball machine in the house.  My kids don\'t chew gum at this point in their lives unless it\'s a special treat from Gramma, but I\'m liking the idea of having one in the house for the sole purpose of rewarding super excellent behavior.  So, once all three of the gumball charts are filled, we\'ll head to the store to find a real life gumball machine of our own.
I have been flying for over 50 years domesticly and internationally. During that time, I have flown a lot of different airlines.Several years ago, I flew Jet Blue Airways with my daughter and grand-daughter and we absolutely loved it.Jet Blue Airways was clean and looked new.  There was actual enough leg room so you didn\'t feel like you were sitting in the other passenger\'s lap.Jet Blue provided me with many choices of delicious snacks.
What is my end goal? To change something, somehow. Or, at least, to understand better, mejor, and in a way that can contribute to some change being made. Because if nothing gets done... so what? I don\'t want to have just gotten paid to write a big extra-curricular research paper that will do nothing for anybody. I write, this summer, to help myself next spring. I write, next spring, to help us understand. I write, now, for the joy of it, because I am in love with the process. Because this is part of how I process, how I think, how I act.
I thought the snitching phase had died down, but apparently not. Because recently I\'ve been hearing it all over again. And to be honest, I get sick to my stomach when I hear people say that! Why would someone want to save or protect a criminal who has harmed or killed someone!? Why should a murderer or someone who will harm again be allowed to? I mean someone help me out here! Lets say the victim was your best friend, mother or your child. Would\'nt you want someone to come forward?
Some years ago before my mother had passed away she loved to bead and boy did she ever bead the most beautiful of pieces! I thought that today I would show you what she had made for me one St. Patrick\'s Day that I really treasure now.
Jaden and I usually have our date night on Fridays, so we just had one a few hours ago. As usually, it was a hit. Jaden got to pick the date night agenda and he picked books and two Pokemon movies. He asked if we could read three books together and he wanted me to watch two Pokemon movies with him. Well, he fell asleep halfway through the first movie. I ended up taking all 65lbs of him upstairs to his bed, but it was still such a success! He had the biggest smile on his face as he was giving me the 411 on Charizard and Pikachu.
Baby has officially graduated from embryo to fetus and has grown to about 1 inch in length. About the size of a medium green olive. His or her head is continuing to develop and take on more baby-like proportions. This week, tiny muscles are starting to form. This will allow her to move her arms and legs. It will still be awhile before I can feel it though!
This morning, i prayed the\'Prayer of Faith\'and i heard the Lord\'s gentle voice said ,\'Let it be so.\'and it was so . All day, i felt Jesus touching me and to me i had felt a big difference in me. I felt the Holy Spirit all over me and it was so amazing. I kept on thinking Jesus all morning and into the evening. The definition of faith is in Hebrews 11:1. What made thought of Jesus was this song\'I could only imagine
Looking to a,\' to your Classical music collection? Amazon.com is offering a free sampler of five Chopin songs performed by Vitaly Marguilis and Jura Margulis. The sampler comes from the X5 Music Group, and was released on March 1, 2010.
Remember all those\'annoying\'things that women do? Yeah, it occurs to me, as a woman who does precisely none of those things, that guys actually like that.  But check it out, ladies: they\'re sneaky about it.  They give it different names.
i always thought that having a dream is stupid  because people always say, instead of keep dreaming, why can\'t you be practical?? stop dreaming and come back to reality! this is life!! well, what\'s life without a dream, eh? now i know it\'s OK to have a dream, no matter how unreachable or ridiculous it is :) even though i know some dreams are hard to reach, i\'ll still try my best to chase that dreams of mine. sure, maybe i might not be able to reach that dream. but hey, when i look back in my life, at least there won\'t be any regrets! because i\'m a dream-chaser instead of a dream-crusher.
UGH! I cannot believe how late I am with this! We had such a busy week last week! We had something going everyday! Needless to say I didn\'t spend much time on the computer. (That might be a good thing!) Since we have already finished our first week of our 2 week menu I am just going to post this week\'s menu. I will do better next time! I promise!
When searching for a car seat, saftey was our number one priority. Comfort was our second. The Britax line of car seats delivers both.  Yes, they are more expensive than most of the car seats on the market, but once you experience them you will know why. They have the highest saftey rating in the industry, are built crazy strong, and are SO comfy for your little ones. They are easy to clean as all of the covers come off and can be washed as well.
After upgrading from my old manual toothbrush to a Sonicare Electric Toothbrush I would never even consider going back to using my old and outdated toothbrush again. I actually enjoy brushing my teeth now and it does not feel like a chore to do. My teeth feel a completely new level of clean since the switch and I know it is working better when I go to floss and there is barely any food left behind after brushing between my teeth unlike before, although yes flossing is still necessary.
What have you been cooking and eating lately? It\'s been a while since I shared with you what I\'ve been making so I thought it might be fun to share my latest adventure. First of all, I took a pasta making class a couple weeks ago at a place in Waco called Gourmet Gallery. It\'s a cute little kitchen store and they also hold lots of classes where they teach you how to make things such as pasta, tamales, bread, Mediterranean food, Easter desserts...I mean it\'s quite the range of classes. It\'s amazing. The only negative thing is that it costs money to take these classes. (Shocking, I know!) And often more money than I have.
Now that the Zune HD is on sale, and the and the latest Zune 4.0 software is live, we can definitively answer the big question: Has Microsoft finally caught up to Apple in the realm of portable digital music players?After a full, hands-on, lab-tested Zune HD review, we can safely say that the iPod touch is still the king of the hill when it comes to high-end touch-screen devices. Even so, the Zune HD is very impressive and goes a long way to redeem the Zune name. Besides the touch, it\'s easily the next-best MP3 player you can buy. If you want to live outside the iTunes ecosystem, it should be at the top of your list.
I have flown with Thai Air several times and each time it has been fabulous. I always choose to fly with them even if they are more expensive than other airlines. They have great food, and a lot of it....be prepared for a minimum of 5 to 6 meals on your trans-pacific flight. Stewardess\'s uniforms are always colorful and very beautiful.
so i\'ve come to the dark side. well not really but i\'ve bought my first dc comic. and anyone who knows me will tell you that i\'m a marvel girl all the way. well i have gone and bought power girl. and i must say that i love it! it\'s really well written. the only thing i don\'t like is that they draw her with really big boobs. i mean really big boobs. but other then that, i really like the comic. it is on it\'s 10th issue this month and i would really suggest everyone to go out and read it. for once there\'s a good female comic. they give her attitude and don\'t make her this dumb blonde. she can defend herself and she has some spunk to her. she looks good but man she has some punch behind her. so i guess i\'m kicked out of the marvel club house (i have borrowed that statement from the nerdy bird) but i\'m ok with that. power girl is a good read.

In honor of Fringe\'s April 1st return, it appears Walter Bishop is celebrating the Day of Fools by donning a ridiculous wig.  Or maybe it\'s just that Walter\'s \'do is from 1985.  Yes, we will be having some bad 80\'s hair flashbacks in the upcoming mythology heavy episode\'Peter,\'as Walter devles into his son\'s\'otherworldly origins\'with Olivia.  We\'ll also finally meet Peter\'s mother (played by Irish actress Orla Brady).   For those Fringe fans jonesing for a mythos fix, the Spring return sounds like a first class ticket on a Walter Bishop acid trip.   Read on for more head-spinning spoilers.
In a medium saucepan, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Stir in the turkey and flour. A,\' the milk, and heat through. Stir the turkey mixture into the vegetable mixture, and cook until thickened. Cool slightly, then pour mixture into the unbaked pie shell. Roll out the top crust, and place on top of filling. Flute edges, and make 4 slits in the top crust to let out steam.
Over the past few years it seems like cosmetic companies come out with some new life-altering mascara every other week. I\'m never the girl who\'s quick to run out and buy a new tube of mascara because I\'ve found that plenty of them don\'t work at all or that they just don\'t give me the look I\'m going for. Even though I was blessed with a head full of thick hair, my eye lashes, it seems weren\'t so lucky. They are thin and they\'re barely noticeable without mascara. They also have a natural curl which is good because I don\'t have to use an eye lash curler, but it\'s also bad since the curl causes my eye lashes to look short and stumpy.The Maybelline Define A Lash mascara has been on the market for a year or so and it\'s gotten great reviews in magazines and Adriana Lima endorses it.
I am swooning over this dresses on the newly discovered Eve Gravel shop. The shop is Canadian based and sells the most wonderful items. The dresses are all I ever wanted for spring (and all year long). And the model photos are gorgeous! Oh pretty dresses, how I pine for you!
Ever wonder how celebrities get such beautiful, glowing healthy skin? if                                     they\'re not lucky enough to be born with it, like this Hollywood mother-daughter duo,                  they must have some tricks up their sleeves   right? Yup. And though we don\'t claim to be geniuses or anything, from what we\'ve seen on the red carpet    (and learned from the many skin care experts, celebrity makeup artists and top dermatologists we\'ve chatted with), we know that healthy-looking skin starts before you ever pick up your foundation brush. Before you ever try to cover up those dark circles and red or brown spots (aka sun damage and acne). You must first nip imperfect skin in the bud                                          by first a,\'ressing something else: your uneven skin tone.
Maybe it\'s because we\'ve had a few warm days after an extremely hard winter, but I just feel so blessed and so happy. I know that God lives and that he loves me and my family. I\'m so grateful that he blessed me with Michael and my boys and also incredible parents, siblings, in-laws and friends. I love this beautiful Earth and am so grateful that I know where all these blessings originate. I truly am grateful for all God does for me.
....I\'m going on a rant for a few minutes....here\'s my issue.... I understand that there are a lot of dead beats out there who don\'t pay child support after their divorce. But when someone is actually trying.........and not just saying that they are.......then should they really get a lot of crap of not BEING ABLE to pay it?  They may be making a truck payment......just barely by the hair of their chinny chin chin.......but if they don\'t make the truck payment they can\'t work, and if they can\'t work there\'s no possible way of them ever getting caught up on child support. It\'s not like they\'re taking the meager amount of money they are getting an blowing it on anything meaningless. They\'re actually trying to pay bills and do the right thing. Besides being 400 behind isn\'t nearly as bad as being 1300 or more behind....like other people. The way I see it.....yes, child support is supposed to be paid...of course no one is arguing that....and there is no excuse for those who aren\'t even putting out the slightest bit of effort...but if someone is having a hard time...like the loss of a job and not getting anything in between but a few crap opportunities that wind up going nowhere....then shouldn\'t they be cut just A LITTLE SLACK? It\'s not like they lost their job because they stayed out all night drinking and couldn\'t wake up for work.....or decided to go to a bar instead of earning money.....maybe the company they worked for shit on them and they\'ve had a hard time finding anything since. I think people should stop being so vindictive and appreciate the fact that their child actually has someone who is really trying to help support them and is busting their ass to try and make sure they will be able to catch up as soon as possible.  And if people are going to throw\'I need to buy groceries for your ki,\'dor\'I can\'t pay bills because you don\'t pay me,\'please be sure and leave out the part about trying to make it a point to go the movies, or out to eat, or any other outing at least once a week. If you\'re blowing your money doing those things, you can\'t be hurting that bad. You most certainly shouldn\'t threaten the other parent with loss of visitation to their child! Yes the judge may have given you custody......but they\'re still the parent as well. You\'re not only hurting them but you will tear your child apart by using them as a weapon against the other parent!! The ONLY reason that sort of threat should come about is if the child is not being taken care of or is in some sort of dangerous situation while under the supervision of the other parent......and never at any other time. I really hate hearing people do these things to other people. And for no other reason besides the fact they think it\'s a way to keep them under their thumb. Some people think they have to have control of everything..........they need to grow up and realize that nobody ever has full control of anything.  Once they do that, they may be capable of being half way decent people.
ok so maybe my once a week isn\'t turning out the way i had hoped....but it\'s not like i haven\'t thought about blogging! i have. in fact! i kept a pink post it note going on what i needed to blog about. it\'s full. so this will probably be pretty long.  first on the list: i don\'t have enough guy friends. i don\'t necessarily have a LOT of friends. (real friends anyway). but i definitely think i need more male friends. less drama. more laughs. and they generally don\'t get upset when you haven\'t hung out\'in forever\'.  second: i got netflix!! i loooooove it!! seeing a bunch of movies i\'ve wanted to see but haven\'t. and it\'s cheaper. plus i can watch stuff online (too bad i don\'t have internet....). which brings me to point 3. dexter. best tv show ever!!! omg. it\'s disturbing and intriguing all at the same time. brilliant. i\'m obsessed. finished season 1 and am on episode 6 of season 2. i definitely recommend it to anyone who likes suspenseful dramas. but if you don\'t like the F word...maybe steer clear. it\'s shown on showtime and not cable so....but it\'s great!!  fourth: have you ever felt like telling someone to suck it??? cause i have. a lot lately. i truly want to look at someone i can\'t stand and forcefully say\'suck it.\'maybe throw in a bitch at the end too if i\'m feeling really vengeful. i\'m sick of the hypocrisy and dumb assed-ness. (<-totally made up that awesome word just now). but in all seriousness....i want a lot of people to pull their heads out their asses.  fifth: i live next door to Danville. it\'s a place for old people. it helps them find affordable housing and care and what not. but i think a lot of old/homeless people live in the building as well. anyway....either someone is about to croak, or they did b/c for the past week the fire dept has been there every night. i stand on the balcony and watch them. which brings me to point 6. wouldn\'t it be great if a firefighter looked up and saw someone watching them and decided to introduce them self and they fell in love and what not??? not saying me of course. it was just a crazy thought i had. then my next thought was, what a great novel! someone should get on writing that. stat.
My heart broke once I made a decision. I knew I could second guess my decision forever, so I promised myself not to dwell on it. We bought Pikachu and brought her home. Just like with the stuffed dogs, I wish I could have brought all the guinea pigs home and spoiled them like I am and will do to Pikachu.  It\'s only been two days since we brought her home, and I already can\'t imagine what it would have been like if I\'d chosen the other guinea pig.  Guinea pigs are more like cats than dogs, in the sense that you have to earn their love. They\'re also prey animals so they\'re skittish and wary of humans. But Pikachu is adjusting to her new life. She wouldn\'t eat the first day when we were in the room, but overnight she ate a little. Now she\'s drinking water and eating lettuce and squeaking happily when we pet her behind her ears.  When I was researching guinea pigs online, everyone who owned them and talked about them on forums and websites were really.. I don\'t know how to put it, but attached I guess? You can tell they think of them like family. Just like people think of dogs like family, but maybe a little more obsessed. Some people give their guinea pigs entire rooms instead of cages. But now I can see where they\'re coming from because I do love Pikachu like she\'s family already. I doubt I\'d ever have a room for guinea pigs, but I\'m totally creepy guinea pig lady over Pikachu ;) Posted by caitlyndelaney at 12:34 AM 0 comments Tuesday, July 28, 2009 I\'m going to get a guinea pig. One night, I randomly looked into getting some dwarf hamsters because I remember going to Pet Co. last year and thinking they were cute. I just want a small pet because I can\'t have a dog and I miss having a pet. The more research I did about dwarf hamsters, though, the less appealing they became. They\'re appartently not very tame and have only been domesticated for about a decade. They also are cannibalistic toward their young. However, I never wanted or looked into a guinea pig because I thought they were too big but I had heard great things about them.  Then I went to visit Mike\'s sister Nicki and she has one named Yoshime. I\'d never really paid much attention to her before, but I really fell in love with her. Nicki let her out and let her run around and she was adorable. So then I started researching and Mike even said he\'d be interested in getting one now.  I got really excited like a little kid and I got my hopes up. Then we started talking about how our apartment building wouldn\'t allow pets. We thought about hiding it from them, but the landlords and maintenance burst into our apartments all the time unannounced so it would basically be impossible. I lost all hope, but decided to call anyway and check, even though our lease says\'NO PETS AT ALL. ANY PETS FOUND WILL RESULT IN AN IMMEDIATE FINE OF $1,500 AND THE PET MUST BE REMOVED.\'I called our apartment the next day, completely prepared. I had my confident voice and I had all my rebuttals ready. Once they said no, I was going to tell them that I could certainly understand, but that I was willing to pay a pet deposit and that I would let them check up on the guinea pig at any time. However, I never had to use any of those rebuttals. The lady answered the phone and I asked if guinea pigs were allowed. She aske,\'dWill it be in a cage?\'and I sai,\'dOf course.\'And then she said it would be allowed.  So then I decided that I\'m definitely going to get a guinea pig. I\'m going to wait until we move into our new apartment on the 21st. Hopefully this isn\'t just a phase for me and a guinea pig will be a wonderful and friendly a,\'ition to the new apartment.
Today has gone well. I decided I can\'t just cold turkey quit smoking, so I\'ve cut down a lot. I use to smoke a pack a day, but today I only smoked 3. So I\'m hoping cutting down slowly will help me quit. I\'ve had the taste of alcohol in the back of my throat all day but I\'ve been fighting the urge to drink. It also helps that I moved into my mom and her boyfriend\'s house yesterday. They don\'t keep alcohol in the house. So that is helping a lot with the situation. I also moved to a new town which will be very helpful with my change. It will allow me to concentrate on it alot more. Also I can make new friends that support my decisions. Apparently there is a really good church here with a good youth group so I\'ll have to check that out soon. I\'m hopefully going to be finding a job soon and getting my own car. This will help a lot with finding new friends.
The 4 Stages of Converse Shoes  I\'ve been through a lot with my onverse shoes. I\'ve warn them throught my liffe so i know what it is like and I know the features of when you get new ones. I recently got new ones and i just want to tell you the 4 stages from when you first buy the shoes and when you just cant where them anymore. HAHA  1. This is the first stage of your new converse shoes. When you first try them one they are like totally cool and new but they havent really FIT in with the size of your feet. They can feel hard and very new. 2. The second stage is when the converse FIT in with your feet. BUT they just start to squeak. I was walking bye in the hallways of my school one day and it startd to squeak, and i noticed that all my converse shoes have done that. I didnt like it. Its kinda embarrassing. 3. This is probab;y my favorite stage. The squeak just gos away and it fits within my foot. 4.The last stage. I\'ts wearing out and the the word ALL STAR has just disappeared. Time to get new ones.  Those were all the stages. But theres one thing about converse shoes that I hate. EVERY time i put them on i have to stick my finger in the shoe to get my foot in and my finger is like rubbing against the shoes and it hurts like really bad. Well not that bad. hehe thanks 4 reading this.
So today, was long. I woke up early and finished an essay went to class not too lively of a day.  But as I was walking home I heard a strange noise and as I walked closer to this man I noticed he was playing bagpipes. It was pretty interesting, I can say I have ever really seen someone play bagpipes in person before.  Now back to homework.So I have started classes again and to my amazement the three of my five classes all require course work to be done and turned in online. I am ok with this but the think that really irritates me is that each class uses a different website. One has Motif one Turnitin one D2L whatever that is. (desire to learn). AND it doesn\'t stop there I need an Iclicker. What the F*%k is an Iclicker. Incase you were wondering like I was an Iclicker is a device used to participate in class. What happen to the good old-fashioned hand-raising, or class discussion. Well thats it for now.  I have to go register on my class websites.
Everyone forgets that Icarus also flew. It\'s the same when love comes to an end, or the marriage fails and people say  they knew it was a mistake, that everybody  said it would never work. That she was old enough to know better. But anything  worth doing is worth doing badly.  Like being there by that summer ocean on the other side of the island while  love was fading out of her, the stars  burning so extravagantly those nights that  anyone could tell you they would never last.  Every morning she was asleep in my bed like a visitation, the gentleness in her  like antelope standing in the dawn mist.  Each afternoon I watched her coming back  through the hot stony field after swimming,  the sea light behind her and the huge sky  on the other side of that. Listened to her  while we ate lunch. How can they say  the marriage failed? Like the people who  came back from Provence (when it was Provence)  and said it was pretty but the food was greasy.  I believe Icarus was not failing as he fell,  but just coming to the end of his triumph.
And when I speak German, I have to express myself in exactly the same way. I can\'t convey the dark subtleties of  my inner-being to the person in front of me. I ask. I get. Simple as. So naturally, my personality and view of the world, how others percieve me and how I percieve myself, changes automatically.  When I visit a restaurant and my meal isn\'t quite right, I have to tell the staff, as clear as day, what\'s wrong with it. Straight off. If I were in England, given the nature of our language, I would be ridiculously apologetic for any inconvenience I may have caused them. If I said roughly the same thing in German, the waiter would look at me quizzically and ask what I\'d done to it. In English I\'remember\'; in German I\'remind myself\'.  In English, I am the height of politeness. In German, I am constantly apologising for things I haven\'t done - and therefore just a bit weird. And in French? I am a German - over-rolling my\'r\'s and sticking verbs at the end of sentences. The languages I speak: as much as I may try to contort the words into something understandable to a native, you can guarantee that the words are contorting me twice as much.  Foreign languages - the best and quickest way to contract multiple personality disorder, what say you?
It has been more than one year from when I wrote my last blog. I require a lot of motivation to do this and of course a good reason as well. Today I\'ve got both to do this again. It\'s my 23th birthday, which is so specially to be cherished for the rest of my life.  I had it in Gottingen. Although far away from family, I\'ve got all the friends celebrated with me at the same time. Messages from friends all over the world--- Swiss, America, Belgium, and France and for certain Home. What\'s so surprising is the email from Michiru who is a friend of mine in Japan. Despite the fact that she\'s been very busy with becoming a mother, she still remembers to send her best wishes just in time!!
....Nothing much to write about today. Nothing has pissed me off, nothing making me feel like turning cartwheels. Although, if I turned a cartwheel right now, it would probably end up in a trip to the emergency room and that would piss me off. I just felt like typing so random stuff floating around in my head is ending up here.  Is that how you spell babbling? for some reason it doesn\'t look correct, but spell check says it is right. hmmm? Oh well.  Why is it the games Dare likes the most are the ones with the most annoying sounds? Why is he soooo good at them?  I kinda miss the simple games I used to play. Especially the one where you shoot at the gopher stealing carrots out of your garden. If you hit him he would say\'ugh, I\'m hit. Going down.\'If you only came close he would jump up and down saying\'what was that for you idiot?\'and then flip you off. I missed on purpose often. Drove my mom insane.
For example, there was a friend who was committed to some guy. And then we happened to ask this girl whether she was sure that this was the guy she wished to be with even after say, 10 years. The answer was \'no\'. Then, why? The question is WHY? Why do people stick with people, get into a relation, have fun, and then break up? I don\'t say that all people are the same, and many of them are faithful, but there are many who are not. And even if we recognize the true colours of people, why do we keep passing on time in futile? Time pass? Is that the motive of all this? Love is so fuckin\' blind? Are we stupid? Yes. Amen.  There was another guy who claims that he had a break up with his girl because that girl hated his doggy and hence, she dumped him. Now. Where is co-operation? Adjustment? What is love? 0_o  People might ask me to ease down a bit, and take things a bit lightly. They might tell me that I am too serious about life. But hell, atleast I think a couple of times before wasting my time on something or someone. Why holler around with something or someone with no purpose what-so-ever?  Another example: friend showing all the smses of a drunk lover:\'ohh maan...your hazel eyes...and your lips...blu blu..bli bli bli...bla bla...\'She laughed at him. And I laughed back loud like an immature oaf. And it seems to be a claimed fact that at the peak of teenage, you are supposed to take the opposite sex a bit lightly. Every Romeo, every cribbing lover happens to be a bastard within with verses of Satan running through his blood. Ahan. We girls(I mean, my species of girls) don\'t like it when a guy just uses the ladies and we love the \'one man for a life time\'-and-the-blah-blah philosophy. But there are girls who can bet on their life to claim that we have to be treated the way we are being treated right now. A girl herself told a guy, that this is the age where we are supposed to know how the opposite sex is, and just hang out with her, and do \'time pass\', and not to get too serious about her(say, expert guidance in misguiding the people trudging on right paths). Alright, everyone seems to be stuffed up with the same shit. Not cool. This seems so correct to most of the people, surprisingly. But for me, it seems so utter rubbish. Seems like some unwritten law. Not cool. It\'s crappy and unnerving.
I don\'t wanna get hung up on details, or this thing could get long and complicated, so I\'ll start with some highlights.    Christmas morning was lovely and peaceful.  The Boy is sweet and gracious, and he was so good all day that I\'m still not sure it wasn\'t a coma dream.  Or that Ward drugged him...    I know for sure though, that drugged is the way to celebrate, as a started getting hit with a cold on Wednesday night, and dosed myself with Dayquil all day yesterday.  It slowed my mind just enough that it was like I was watching a home movie.  It was marvelous, really.
Sometimes I feel like Willie Lohman, only I\'m much happier. I\'ve been on the road since the end of February. I flew to BWI (Baltimore International Airport), spent a night or two with friends in DC, and then began my journey down to South Florida. After an 8 hour drive I spent the night in St. George, SC. After a morning of not taking advantage of the free processed food , but loving the free treadmill, I ventured on down to Daytona, where Bike Week was in full swing. Friends had rented a gorgeous house in an old neighborhood, with huge oaks and pines and imaginary bobcats.  The minute I entered Florida on Hwy 95 I was engulfed in nostalgia. I remembered walking hand in hand with Paul on the Mayport beach at the intersection of canal and Atlantic. We later took the same walk when I was pregnant and we conversed about how excited I was to be introducing a soul to our wayfarer lifestyle with all it\'s beauty and spontaneity.  In Daytona, my girlfriend & I visited the legendary Iron Horse Saloon, it is what I refer to as\'Thunder Dome\'. Again, I was taken back to another year, another time, Pre- Adrian. It was the year 1999 when I first entered this bar with it\'s multi level swing bridges and burn out pits and I knew for sure that Tina Turner would come swinging down any minute.  My next stop took me to one of the equestrian capitols of the world. It was great seeing old friends and catching up.  My greatest fun, was visiting Nicky. I trained Nicky to take over my job as a shore excursion tour director for the cruise ships in St. Thomas in 1999. She was then my boss as the Atlantis Submarine, a real submarine that took 54 people down 90 feet to a fed coral reef. Nicky now works as a director for a privately owned cruise ship for the elite billionaires of the world. We had a blast. She\'s from Whales and we are comfortable enjoying a good cuppa.  I\'m staying in Florida longer than expected. Weather and expectations may be better.  Traveling for hours at a time with no dial on the radio worthwhile, with lots to ponder and a journal for contemplating. When the day is done it is satisfying and rewarding. Good friends, good memories, lots of self exploration.
What else? Hmmmmm....oh, I had an interesting string of conversations with Alyssa recently. Apparently my aunt snapped a couple weeks ago and sent Aly the longest email ever as an attempt to make amends with her. They haven\'t gotten along for years and years. Alyssa was so upset by the email that she sent it to me for some advice. It was such a slap in the face. I talked on the phone with her for over an hour, two different days. Actually, both days I ended up sitting out in my car in the driveway. That is my weird solution to preventing myself from pacing when I\'m on the phone for a long time. Eventually our conversation got away from the bullshit with her mom and we caught up about everything else. Alyssa is yet another person that I can talk to about anything. I guess I\'m really lucky in that way. Why is it that so many great conversations take place while in the car? Maybe it\'s just me, but I\'ve had some friendship-changing conversations on a late-night drive on a long road. I have a really fun week ahead of me. I\'m seeing my very first Broadway show, and I\'m taking a roadtrip to a place I\'ve never been before. Hopefully some of the things that I\'ve ordered as Christmas and Birthday (and baby shower) gifts will start showing up in the mail. I want a better idea of the dent I\'ve made in my holiday shopping. Ok, soooooo, yeah. I guess that\'s all for now.
Even when I first started, the lunches were much better than your average school lunch. The kitchen exclusively served organic milk and yogurt, and the salad bar always had lettuce, tomatoes, and other fresh vegetables.  Even with a few great items in the cafeteria, it still has a long way to go. The majority of students and staff eat food from the main meal line, and the food is just a small step up from an average school lunch. Hot dogs, hamburgers, nuggets, and pizza are monthly mainstays. Yes, the hot dogs might be lower sodium and the buns are made with whole wheat, but healthy and nutritious, they are not.  Before taking this job, I worked in a few upscale restaurant kitchens as a cook, pastry chef, and sous chef. I rarely cooked at home, and I ate pretty poorly during those years. It made me wonder why I was cooking in the first place.  I would never have guessed I would end up working in a school cafeteria five years ago. New York City was just beginning to revamp its school lunch program when I was finishing up culinary school. They were hiring at my culinary school\'s career fair. I was interested, but I didn\'t linger at their booth too long. Why would I spend two years of my life learning to cook and then work for a school, where little cooking is done on premises?  Several years later and exhausted from twelve hour days feeding a select few restaurant-goers, I began to think about school food. I heard more and more about people like Alice Waters and Ann Cooper. I taught a free cooking class for high school students and their stories reminded me how bad school lunch can be. At some point, tackling a stagnant school food system seemed much more interesting than making truffle risotto day in and day out.
This morning I gave someone a gift which spread a smile across their face. That was the best feeling ever, to know that making a small amount of effort would improve their day dramatically!   I am of course talking about Mother\'s Day. Today I gave my Mum a 2ft card and a small te,\'y bear (which she\'s now called Aristotle..!), and the smile that came on her face was brilliant :) I\'m really glad she likes it, and today things seem to be a lot more on the up for her, which is a relief considering last week.   As for myself, well today is another day of normality. I\'m dying for a week Saturday to come, when unbelievably huge deadlines are out of the way. Every night of this week is going to be dedicated to making some form of draft of my dissertation. I know fully well it won\'t be anywhere near the standard my final draft will be, but heck, why not make the effort and get some useful feedback. I got a 2.2 for the dissertation report that I did, which was 20% of my overall dissertation grade. Granted, it was a low 2.2, but heck, it could\'ve been a 3rd! So that\'s given me a bit of a boost. I know fully well my stress levels will go through the roof this week because of my work, but i\'ll manage hopefully :) And the weekend will bring some much needed relaxation and giggles!
Recently, spm resultt released. Those people around me, have a great result. This make me stress. I stress, not because i scared and hate the feeling of lose. I stress as i don\'t want to disappoint my parents. They have been putting a lots of hope on me, since i get i a great result at kinder garden. It also mean, my childhood is in stress. Though, i appreciate what they have done. Thanks mum, dad. Although stress, I suppose i will go through it by myself. I will try my best to not disappoint u all. Bro, thanks for your support. You are the best brother in the world. SPM,Me, Rainie, never scare of YOU. As what Asson say, angel is always by my side.
I\'ve been running this off and on cold for three days now. It started with IMMENSE fatigue and soreness, so I thought it was the flu, but then it never digressed into upper-respiratory torture? Then on Saturday it was nonexistent, then today I feel sick again (but still no nose slobber). Maybe it\'s some order of slow burning swine flu that in a week or two will finally come around to making me do my sickness hibernation techniques.  So I have my very own apartment now and all of you should be fucking proud of me, because other than that one time in Asheville (some of you may affectionately remember the hemp-hill home) I have never done this all on my own before. And I do mean all on my own, down-posits, rent, contracts. Talking to them. You know, stuff adults do.  I\'m going to paint the walls purple and put those glow in the dark stars on my ceiling. Christmas lights will be a-plenty. I already have some dank smelling candles from IKEA that stank up the apartment like crisp cinnamon apple (and now it smells like a thousand cinnamon orgasms).  I live in NW balls deep in the city and I wouldn\'t have it any other way.
I am honored that my painting \'The Divine Mother\' (4\' x 8\', acrylics) has caused such controversy. The theme of the 2007 Artery Exhibit in Eureka Springs, AR was Icons, and I chose to paint what I believe to be one of the most beautiful and inspirational iconographic themes that transcends the world of art to include the history of mankindó the simple and beautiful image of a woman breastfeeding her child. The judges at the Portfolios.com Creative Awards, an international competition, also found this to be beautiful and gave me an award for this painting (Illustration \'08). Since ancient times, people have been so inspired by the beauty of this image that incredible myths and religious stories and artwork have been created, even worshipped. This includes depictions of the Egyptian Go,\'ess Isis breastfeeding baby Horus, an ancient myth which bears striking similarity to and which many scholars say inspired the Madonna del Latte or Maria Lactans imagery of Europe, which reached the height of its popularity in the mi,\'le ages. I title my painting \'The Divine Mother,\' though it is not a depiction of the Virgin Mary, as many people erroneously believe. The Virgin Mary is just one divine mother icon of many; my divine mother is one of unity, love, gentleness, compassionóand so she combines world traditions and religions, transcending time and space, melding pre-Christian religions with Christianity to be an icon we can all identify with and find peace and beauty with. Look closely at her faceóit is half-blue (many Egyptian statues of Isis are blue) , and she is wearing Egyptian makeup. As many people have noticed, I put a new twist on this subject by a,\'ing the text \'Does this halo make my face look fat?\' to the painting. The Madonna Lactans and Isis imagery began as a way to show the compassion of the divine mother and therefore to make her more real, human, and accessible to us. A,\'ing the text was my attempt to refresh and modernize this themeóto make her accessible, relevant, and real to a modern audience. The divine mother, in all her forms, is undeniably the greatest supermodel of the art world since the beginning of mankindóso I believe that like you, she worries about how she looks in a painting, photograph, or sculpture!
A question for God looms in my mind like water rolling and spinning; chortling into an abyss of time. When I was nineteen I was dying so that I could live. I survived this challenge to come through this lifetime with the knowledge that God is within.   I was a college student, home for the summer and had gone to a party. At that party there was drinking and pot smoking. A good friend\'s boy friend had come on to me and I was tempted to flirt back. In fact, I did flirt back. I was young. I was beautiful and I was an atheist.    A year earlier my longest childhood friend had a swimming pool accident which left her a paraplegic. My friend, the athlete was changed forever and I felt guilty. It was the unreasonable kind of guilt that summons over the young just because it can and it did. My friend was changed and I too changed. I grew angry, and in a way I became uncaring about life itself.   I learned years later that often when we have profound thoughts they can manifest into reality. My thoughts at that time were, \'Why didn\'t it happen to me?\'   That night of drunken partying with a cute boy who was supposedly attached to a good friend I got into my car to drive home and through no fault of my own was hit. Su,\'enly my car flew out of control spinning around and around in the darkened summer night. I sat in the driver\'s seat with voices going through my mind of my father and my brother, \'Don\'t do this....Do that!\' Paralyzed I began to pray, \'Dear God! I don\'t know what to do! Help me!\' In that moment I gave up my arrogance and went into complete surrender and when I did that an extreme and blinding white shield of light came directly out of my chest surrounding me like an egg shell.   The car continued to spin and finally slammed into an apartment building narrowly missing a telephone pole. I jumped out of the car mainly to see if I could still walk. My car was totaled, but I was okay.    The man who had hit me had been \'joy racing\' with another driver going over 90 miles per hour and I had inadvertently gotten into his way.
Being that my school is on a year round schedule, there is always one\'track\'of kids not at the school for a few weeks at a time. Though I like the sporadic breaks here and there, a small void is always felt for those fellow teachers you work with that are gone for a few weeks. So a few times this school year, a group of my work friends have met up at the Cheesecake Factory for random visits with friends that we have been missing at work. Last week, a Cheesecake Factory trip was planned for this week to play catch up with some of our dear track 4 (off track) teachers. . . or so I thought. . .  I should have been a little suspicious when one teacher wished me a happy birthday today at work. . ..\'uhhh thanks. . . but a few weeks late! Where are you getting this information?\'Well. . . my brain got a thinking, and sure enough. . . I found myself at Cheesecake Factory dinner not in honor of missing our friends (though I think that is still a big part of it), but rather for a Happy Birthday Shawna dinner! The food was good, the dessert was even better, but the company was by far the best! These ladies have truly become some of my favorite people that I can go to for a laugh or a cry during a time in my life where I have no super close friends in proximity. Today was by far a rather crappy day at work, but who can understand what Im going through better than this group of people? They really know how to make a person feel much better about themselves. Who would\'ve guessed that a two week late birthday dinner could be such perfect timing??  By the end of the night I even got one of them to agree to become a garbage man with me as long as I drive and let her ride the back! Awww. . . now that\'s  what friends are for!
Having mono during school has been really difficult for me. I am constantly tired. Not only is it hard for me to wake up in the morning, it\'s hard for me to find the motivation to go to class, study and get work done. The doctor said the fatigue could go away in 2 weeks and it could last for 3 months. It\'s been almost 3 weeks and I feel just as tired as before.  I can already tell that this is not going to be a dean\'s list semester. I\'m disappointed with myself, but I feel so helpless. I can\'t even ask my teachers for a break because UHS won\'t give me permission to miss any classes.  Not only is my academic life suffering, but so is my social life and my emotional well-being. I don\'t have the energy to straighten my hair any more and my self-esteem takes a hit every time I look in the mirror. I think the huge bags underneath my eyes are permanent. The apartment is a mess too, which I can\'t live with. Cluttered house, cluttered mind. You\'re supposed to lose weight with mono, but all I can do is sit on the couch and I\'m not allowed to exercise, so I fear I\'m gaining weight.  I need to turn this around. This is a challenge. If I got dean\'s list this semester, I would be incredibly proud of myself. I know I shouldn\'t be straining myself, but I need to push myself because right now, I\'m not really pushing myself at all.
As I\'ve been gleefully exclaiming to all and sundry on my Youtube channel, yesterday I went for some Afternoon Tea (the very phrase conjures pomposity unlimited and therefore regally requires capital letters) at a very posh hotel in London with an intimidating dress code and a price list even more so. So finally, after a lot of to-ing and fro-ing and wandering about the flat in semi-constructed and poorly-considered outfit choices, we finally managed to mobilise our troops and begin our expedition to somewhere a little different.  I held Kiwi\'s hand as we nervously shuffled past the doormen of the Connaught Hotel and crossed the threshold, half expecting to be rebuffed by a cross-looking moustache in a top hat and tails, or for the unsmiling host blocking our entry to our desired destination to tell us that we were unsuitably attired, or our reservation could not be located.  Feeling none of the bravado of Red Riding Hood, I felt a little lost in the woods as we were ushered to a seat and sat down before my seat was pushed in. Luckily there was no slapstick tumble to the floor, rather an awkward pause as I calculated the distance between myself and the table, and the danger of dropping one of those so-carefully prepared pastries into that unavoidable gap. I stood up awkwardly and let the nice lady with the grey suit push my chair in a little further.
There\'s so much to say. Every little nuance of life becomes exaggerated when you\'re in the hospital. Every interaction becomes multiplied in meaning. Every small exchange between me and the saviors-in-scrubs became a desperate reliance on their expertise and kindness.  I feel like the hospital is the gateway from death into brith and life into death. I was  born in one and I\'ve been near death in many. My hospital visits for my various illnesses and surgeries are like the punctuations in my rambling life.  Yesterday\'s surgery went well and by well I mean my knee should be improving and I didn\'t die.  My surgeon explained the\'mess\'my knee was in. There was the\'fracture\'in the cartilage, fairly new (happened 11 months ago) that needed to be cleaned up. Then there was the bone-on-bone arthritis that had to be dealt with. Meniscus shavings were all over the place causing pain and inflammation. He cleaned up what best he could. We\'ll be doing protein injections in about a month to ease the arthritis. I\'m optimistic.  The pain is pretty bad but I have plenty of pain killers. I was urged to take them and to get rest. No need to be the tough-guy by not taking the meds. See, pain is a signal to the body that something is wrong. Pain puts the body in crisis mode. Fight or flight crisis responses do not facilitate healing. Taking the pain killers and resting tells the body that it\'s time to heal. Now if only I would stop fussing around the house and get some rest!!
The second man fumbled with his hands as he stood behind his friend. I realized the second man was mentally challenged and the blue-eyed gentleman was his salvation. I held my tears as I stood there with them.  The young lady at the counter asked him what they wanted. He said, \'Coffee is all Miss\' because that was all they could afford. (If they wanted to sit in the restaurant and warm up, they had to buy something. He just wanted to be warm). Then I really felt it - the compulsion was so great I almost reached out and embraced the little man with the blue eyes.  That is when I noticed all eyes in the restaurant were set on me, judging my every action. I smiled and asked the young lady behind the counter to give me two more breakfast meals on a separate tray. I then walked around the corner to the table that the men had chosen as a resting spot. I put the tray on the table and laid my hand on the blue-eyed gentleman\'s cold hand. He looked up at me, with tears in his eyes, and said, \'Thank you.\' I leaned over, began to pat his hand and said, \'I did not do this for you. God is here working through me to give you hope. I started to cry as I walked away to join my husband and son. When I sat down my husband smiled at me and said, \'That is why God gave you to me, Honey, to give me hope..\' We held hands for a moment and at that time, we knew that only because of the Grace that we had been given were we able to give.  In my own way I had touched the people at McDonald\'s, my son,the instructor, and every soul that shared the classroom on the last night I spent as a college student.
Well I was just sitting here wondering what the next step is. Anybody that knows me will tell you that I\'m a person who likes things planned out. But at this time in my life I am not the one in charge of making the plans. I have met a wonderful guy who treats me like gold. But when will he ask me to be his wife? I have gotten my diabetes under control. But when will God make me a mother? I have worked so hard on getting to this point in my life I just wonder what\'s the next step?
I want this on my body, I want a tattoo, I want a lot of tattoos. First of them has to be a simple heart on my right foot to carry on a simple tradition. Ya see my best friend from the age of about three is going to carry on the tradition of the\'foot heart tattoo\'or whatever it is and I have agreed to embark on this with her. So I cant start my ink filled journey without her.. the journey should start soon... Hopefully.  So with no direction and the never ending search for a career path growing more and more difficult I have decided to vent.. to blog. A bit about myself I am a student, studying who knows what at this moment. Transcript says in store for my next semester is French, Sign Language, English 300 and 302 Magic, Witchcraft and Religion, and fitness. We\'ll see how that goes. I have a strong passion for languages, and culture. I would love to be a reporter, or a medic, a translator, a psychiatrist, I\'d love to do it all. First I have to settle on a major, at the moment I am thinking a double major in Communications and International Relations. Or Linguistics. This is going to be harder than I thought..  Well I that\'s it for now I have to call it a day I have a job interview tomorrow. Wish me luck.
Last night I was overjoyed to see that the snowpeas that I\'ve been cultivating for about 4 months now are finally bearing fruit. Like me, they\'ve had to show a lot of determination in a place with so little arable land! Boxed in next to my window in a little window-size container they are now happily producing. I can\'t wait to taste them. To celebrate the occasion, I\'ve asked two friends for dinner next week. I\'ve already tried the lettuce I\'ve been growing, and to be honest, it didn\'t seem like anything special, but my friends pronounced it very \'fresh!\' It seems like things might be turning a corner for me as well. For most of this month I\'ve been able to come home before the sky turned black, my email inbox has never gone over 101 unopened messages, I\'ve finally gotten most of my a,\'ress changes done and my Christmas decorations are finally down! I\'m hopeful that my growing understanding of school life and the reduction of my weekly hours will enable me to have something left to give or do after the day\'s work is over. Thank you, Lord!
I\'m not exactly sure what to feel at this point. As a little girl you grow up believing your father is like superman and nothing can hurt him except for kryptonite. As you get older of course, that belief fades and you realize that he is human just like everyone else. But a part of you still wants to hold on to it. Watching my father in that hospital bed made me truly understand how fragile life truly is..........I\'m going to miss my da,\'y.........I hope he found a happier place to be.
Sometimes we  wonder, \'What did I do to deserve this?\' or \'Why did God have to do this  to me?\' Here is a wonderful explanation! A daughter is telling her Mother  how everything is  going wrong, she\'s failing algebra, her boyfriend broke up with her and  her best friend is moving away.  Meanwhile, her Mother is baking a  cake and asks her daughter if she would like a snack, and the daughter  says, \'Absolutely Mom, I love your cake.\'  \'Here, have some  cooking oil,\' her Mother offers.  \'Yuck\' says her  daughter.  \'How about a couple raw eggs?\' \'Gross,  Mom!\'  \'Would you like some flour then? Or maybe baking  soda?\'  \'Mom, those are all yucky!\'  To which the mother  replies: \'Yes , all those things seem bad all by themselves.. But when  they are put together in the right way, they make a wonderfully delicious  cake! \'  God works the same way. Many times we wonder why He would  let us go through such bad and difficult times. But God knows that when He  puts these things all in His order, they always work for good! We just  have to trust Him and, eventually, they will all make something  wonderful!  God is crazy about you. He sends you flowers every  spring and a sunrise every morning. Whenever you want to talk, He\'ll  listen. He can live anywhere in the universe, and He chose your  heart.   I don\'t know who wrote this, it was sent to me and I wanted to share .. cute! I just wanted to remind you all that if you need prayer or just someone to talk to just send me a message! I\'m here for YOU! Alrighty tell me what you thought of this! Tell me about your ingredients!!
I recently received an email regarding being Catholic and boycotting the latest instalment of the series that sent many a devout Catholic seething into pits of Rage (one of the 7 deadly sins, ironically). Funny though, in a related link, the Vatican doesn\'t seem to care too much. Is this a case of a different kind of crucifixion in today\'s age of finding an identity?
The person that shares my life and space on occasion, just happens to be named on deed and possession, as I am on theirs. A protection thing for both of us, assuring that the other will oversee all, if one of us cannot.  We share the space of the abode, bedroom each (though somehow I got the small one without the walkin closet.) and we share the computer/office room and the other open spaces of the house. But, it seems I type too loud, and so the other must move office and their computer to another space, and I can keep the old. But, though the big bedroom is twice the size of mine, there seems not enough room for ALL the office equipment. So, a,\'itional space is claimed for that purpose, Half the sunporch/entertainment room. The rational being,\'it\'s half my house and you have your room, the computer room, the living room, the kitchen, and I need more space for meetings and connsultations, etc . .\'. . .but . . .seems to me some of that\'my\'space is joint, enjoyed by both.  I do not want the sunroom halved, for the purpose of providing more office space, when there was already room enough in the computer room. And, I do not type too loud . .not always. The sunroom is a many-windowed and sunny room with views in three directions, also giving access to the yard and pool. The best room in the house (not counting the other bedroom with walkin closet)  I am impossible. I am selfish. It is NOT about me.  I fear I shall soon be part owner of a duplex.
Friends?   I\'m the chewing gum stuck to your sole. I\'m the rain that soaks your trousers. I\'m the crumbs in your bed. I\'m the shoelace that breaks when you\'re in a hurry. I\'m the rubbish you forgot to put in the bin. I\'m the person who forgets to listen when you talk. I\'m the glob of toothpaste on your newly-washed sweater. I\'m the song you can\'t get out of your head. I\'m the monotonous sound that wakes you up when you\'ve taken the morning off. I\'m the clothes you\'ve become tired of. I\'m the shoe that chafes your foot. I\'m the food with too many calories. I\'m the wind that wrecks your hairdo. I\'m all the people who stare when you\'re feeling sad. I\'m the headache the day after. I\'m the telephone that rings when you\'ve just fallen asleep. Will you still be my friend?
Eugh. The past two days, ive seen you twice. You know what, it still kills me. I attempt to talk to you now, and its like nothing. It\'s like we\'ve never met. I can\'t believe it all stilled happened. I can\'t believe i fell for YOU. What an idiot ay ? We used to be so close. You\'d lend me your jacket, walk me home, make sure i gave YOU a hug and you ran after me when i was upset and we sat and talked for hours. You made me feel so amazing. A feeling ive never felt before. You knew my family, maaaaan didn\'t they fucking love you. You made sure i was always safe, you took care of me when we out that night in that club, even after what happened at that party. Don\'t tell me you never felt anything for me, cus we both know that\'s a lie. I just can\'t believe after everything, our friendship means nothing to you anymore. I miss you. I NEED to get over you. In my own way i have. I\'ve HAD to. I just can\'t believe you were to fucking scared to get it a chance. Just remember, if you\'re ever reading this, you told me once, you couldnt lose anymore people in your life, i understood you, you used to try so hard to make sure we never lost contact. You\'d even make the time in your\'busy\'life to see me after school, and we\'d sit in subway chatting about your hard times :/ I can\'t believe it came to this, we were so close, still could\'ve been, probably would have made my life so much fucking easier. But no, you took the coward\'s way out, becus you were\'too scared\'well from now on. I\'m never letting you in my life again. You had your chance. I love you. End of.
OK, How many of you like to receive a nice letter in the mail from a friend?  I know I do.  Even though most of the time I get the mail from the mailbox it is junk mail, I still enjoy the wonder of\'will there be a letter?\'On small occasions there is a letter that you open and savor.  A nice card from a friend far away with actual hand written words, possibly in a colorful pen.  You read it once, you read it twice, you may read it everyday for a week or longer.  It inspires you to write one back and maybe even write a letter to a different friend.  In this technological world we all email, face book, blog, etc..... and don\'t get me wrong I love them all, but what has happening to letter writing.  We say we have no time, but really how many hours do we spend on the computer blogging or facebooking. So why has this art form lost its value?  It has lost its value so much that post offices are closing.  Mail delivery may be shortened by a day.  I had the wonderful opportunity to live on Martha\'s Vineyard for a period of my life . During that time I was an avid letter writer.  Nothing like living on a New England Island in winter to motivate letter writing.  There was this wonderful little store in Vineyard Haven, called Paper Tiger.  It was filled with uniques cards, papers,pens, stamps and stationary sets.  I would walk into town and peruse the store for hours picking out just the right cards for people and write letters.  I think I will make someone happy this week and write them a letter and in the mean time support the postal service.  Just think what would happen if it closed.  Many books and history have been written and recorded through letters.  Let\'s keep our history going!   Happy writing.
I had all these ideas for blog posts about decorating my new house... err, I mean the house we want and are currently in escrow for. You see, this house is thirty years old and absolutely begging for cosmetic work, all in time of course ($$$!). However admist my day dreaming I realized that this house could very well not go through for lord knows what reason. And here I am, planning my life away like I always do. Let\'s focus on the present, April. So ladies and gents, I present you with my new blog layout. I made about five other collages for the header that I may take a vote on, or ask the hubs since my friends on here are quite lacking. Yes yes, I know I just renovated this place not too long ago, but I needed something to take my mind off of possibility. I am in control of this layout, you see, and it just feels right. Thoughts? I am feeling irritated. Perturbed. Surrounded by crazy folks (family, patients) and people who want my money (tax time and despicable landlords).  So this morning as a means to debrief I turned to a picture of my own version of Walden Pond, which led me to Thoreau; Walden and Civil Disobedience:
Now I think about the lives and trials of these women, and then my own. Will there be a reward for me, here on this earth? I don\'t know. There may not be. But I can\'t live my sick life waiting for it. It\'s difficult, more difficult than many can imagine. Having epilepsy, Crohn\'s, depression, anxiety attacks [which are the worst things on the face of the earth], nightmares, and now back pain and some kind of cold virus. I\'m literally *never* healthy. But I take comfort in the fact, the knowledge I am certain of, that one day, I will be completely healed of all my ailments. And I will see Regina, and Betsy, and little Layla Grace, and they will all be healthy too, celebrating God\'s greatness. I look forward to that day. Until then, I wait. Something I don\'t like doing, but maybe I\'ll do some good while I\'m at it.  It helps, to write my thoughts as I\'m going through them. Instead of thinking about it all beforehand, just starting and writing, continuing as I realize new things. So, really, this is more for me than anyone else...
Shopping that is environmentally friendly and easy on the pocket?? Why that would be a clothes swap party my friend! Yes as the Fashion society at Uni we decided to host one this week. Basically you brings some of your clothes that you no longer wear along and then swap them for somebodys else\'s castaways et voila you have new gear that didn\'t cost you a penny! You know what they say one man\'s rubbish is another\'s riches...(that is what they say, right?). Well anyway it was very successful, I got myself a lovely new bag and jumper out of the deal. I would highly recommend you all try it. I also booked my flights to London with my girls yesterday! We are heading for a short break in the easter hols to treat ourselves to plenty of shopping, sight seeing and show stopping adventures. Camden market is on my list of top 5 places in the entire world, so I am very excited to be going back! It\'s such a mesmerising place, so diverse and exciting. And they have the best doughnut stand I have ever seen. I\'m tres excited!
OK, so I know that the blog is supposed to be about Psychology, but I have another passion, Photography. And sometimes the tog in me has to come out and play. Like one night last week, when Cas came home from school demanding to go out, and Gaz suggested we go for a walk. There\'s a resovoir not too far from us called Entwhistle, which is really pretty. So we decided to go there. I grabbed my camera bag with a\'I\'ll only kick myself if I see a shot and haven\'t got my camera\'and off we went. I was soooooo glad I\'d grabbed my camera when we got there! The sun was setting and the lake was partly frozen. The light was amazing, the colours were incredible. It was a VERY slow walk, with my boys sighing every time I lifted the camera again. But I think it was worth it! Judge for yourself......
How was everyone\'s weekend? Well last week I did promise I would \'do\' a post (is that proper blog-inology?) about my Television work in Australia and the US over the past 6 years, so here goes!  At the ripe age of 20, fresh out of Griffith University where I studied Film and Media (there you go Simon Cowell, I am well educated :), I landed my first major gig hosting a daily kids show on the Nine Network Aust. called \'Hot Source\'. This was my training ground for hosting, editing, segment producing, and script writing.My next major move was hosting the daily show \'Studio Disney\' on the Disney Channel. I LOVED loved loved this job so much! I was lucky enough to travel around the world and Australia, and work with the most amazing team. Disney really taught me a lot about the international TV industry, and the work ethics and brand values they hold are second to none.
Hippocrates is known for the Hippocratic oath that medical doctors are sworn by. Hippocrates was the first known physician. His name is also where the word hypocrite originates from. I\'m not sure how it correlates with medicine but I\'ve come to know plenty of hypocrites. Some believe being hypocritical is sometimes in others best interest. Me? I disagree. If people ask questions they can\'t handle the answer to..Why ask? I\'m a rather sensitive soul yet I can appreciate brute honesty any day...over simple hypocritical bullshit! Don\'t keep it Real. Keep it Sincere...Your reality may be askew from mine……
When I was younger, I loved stuffed animals. I had so many stuffed animals in my room and even more beanie babies. Whenever I did get a new stuffed animal, I would always pick one out and then second guess my choice. I would worry about not\'saving\'the other animals from the store.  I vividly remember being in a gift shop of a hotel and picking out a new stuffed animal. There were essentially two different choices. I could get the dog with the brown spots or the dog with the black spots. But it was so much more complicated than that with me. I chose the dog with the brown spots and then I wondered which of the brown-spotted dogs to choose. I closed my eyes quickly picked one up. When I opened my eyes, I looked at all the dogs still on display that I hadn\'t chosen. I promised myself that when I came back to the hotel, I\'d\'save\'the rest of them.  So you can only imagine my struggle in picking out a guinea pig to save at the pet store. The poor little furballs had probably never been touched since they\'d arrived at Pet Co. and they\'re all in the clear plexi-glass boxes, which are horrible for them to begin with, with crappy be,\'ing (litterally) and such little space to move. Thank god we had to get a girl (since Mike\'s sister has a girl guinea pig and we want them to play together without having to worry about little baby guinea pigs), or else the decision would have taken hours.  There were four female guinea pigs available at Pet Co. the day we went in to get our guinea pig. There were two white ones which I quickly eliminated, sadly, completely based on the color of their skin. They had the red eyes and just didn\'t look like guinea pigs really. I felt so bad for them because they would probably not be adopted for a while.. maybe not ever. Just thinking about them now is making me sad. I should have been less appearance-focused and maybe got one of them, but I didn\'t.  It was incredibly hard to decide between the other two. I had liked the one\'s that fur looked like a calico cat\'s. Mike liked the brown one with the white stripe. The guinea pig would be mine, but I wanted Mike to love her too. It was all my decision and I was bringing her into our apartment and he promised he would help financially and with feeding and cleaning her cage. I knew I would love which ever guinea pig we chose.  The calico one was especially cute because her nose was even spotted-- half was white and half was black. But the one with the white stripe was a lot more active. We had actually came to Pet Co. three times in the week and she was always awake and jumping around the cage. The calico one was always asleep. Also, Mike and I had decided on a name beforehand, Pikachu, and the brown one looked more like a\'Pikachu\'to me. So based on her personality, the name we chose and Mike\'s previous opinion that he liked the brown one more, I chose the brown one.
ow do you deal with grief? i found myself crying last night as i watched a tv show and one of the main characters painfully re-entered the same location where her daughter was su,\'enly taken from her. it reminded me of the night my puppy chucky was taken. now i know an animal can\'t really be compared to a human loss but my little puppy was my angel, my shadow and my baby. i still grieve over the loss and i still see the accident in my head on a regular basis. So this wont get me any fans but i am a self proclaimed high school bully, i am not ashamed of it because it is how i survived high school. i didn\'t bully every one i just picked on certain people and most of the time it was retaliation for shit they had already done to me.  but since school has finished i left my bullying days behind me, i left every one alone. So my question tonight is how do you deal with people who you cant really get rid of? The current pain in my ass happens to be my boyfriends best friends partner so i cant really stomp on her and then scrape her off the bottom of my shoe.  i want to know how you would deal with a person you cant quite get rid of...
Well for those that don\'t know I am taking 10 freshman kids from school to the Grand Canyon over spring break! Yes I have lost my mind.... No I really am excited... I think! We leave early Monday morning for the airport to fly to Las Vegas. Then we fly out the red eye friday night!  So yes I am spending my Spring Break with KIDS what am I thinking? I am sure it will be a vacation I will never forget!
I dont know why its taken me so long to realize most people don\'t live with principles in their lives? I guess since I was raised to carry myself with some integrity...I figured others did the same. No good deed goes unpunished. This I learned the hard way. Humans do not realize they are the very cause of their own demise. In this myriad of complexities we call the matrix or cyber world. People become lost. Hiding behind their pc or phone screen. Playing dress-up for their webcam or camphone. No real friends or relationships. Nothing tangible. Me? I like to be able to reach out n touch someone. Whether it be to show love or put tips on em. Old skool stilo. Just know in my life..Integrity exists. Dignity is honored. Principles matter. When I leave Gods green Earth I can take those with me. The matrix is all an illusion so doesn\'t be mislead.
It started raining Friday morning. And it rained. And then it rained. And then it really rained.  In the wee early hours of Saturday morning the wind became frenzied. An endless whistle punctuated by roaring gusts. The kind of wind that either mutes all other sounds or distorts them into something ominous.  Is that the trees moving? Or is there an army of ninjas crawling on the roof?   Our backyard and the suburban crap sprawl beyond it inclines toward the house. Not the smartest groundbreaking move but it\'s really fine as long as you have a French drain around the foundation.  We do not have a French drain.  We do however have a lovely lakeside view.
I\'m sitting at my computer on this chilly autumn morning with a gentle breeze floating through my very open window. I can see tall trees and a families backyard and i hear men\'s voices as they walk around preparing to demolish the house located just behind mine. I hear trucks, cars and buses on the road, the occasional horn and birds singing their cares away and chattering among themselves.  Today I\'m more expressing a thought then a questions, will the world really change so severely in the next couple of years that if i were doing this in ten years i wouldn\'t hear the noises or see the trees? well i know that by next week i wont see the trees, the block of land they are located on is being flattened so that contractors can build housing commission flats on it.  The whether has gotten a lot chillier since autumn began a few weeks ago, i wrap a blanket around myself every time i leave my bed in the morning. I like the mornings that i look back at my bed after leaving it and i see my partner still laying there sleeping peacefully with his head now laying on the very same pillow mine just left. Its lonely mornings like this one that i dislike.  On days like this i wonder about my future, will i achieve all the goals i want to achieve, will i help, will i still be with him? then i casually shake my head and forget about them, its no use worrying over what is going to happen in a few years when you don\'t even know what might be happening that very day....
I am getting increasingly irritated by the minute. I wish people around me could get over their own inconsequential lives and stop bringing their negativity into the lives of others. I am beyond the point where I can offer empty consolation and sugar-coated words just to seem \'nice\'. I am tired of people who sulk around all day thinking about their own humongous huge issues and \'problems\' and spoil life for EVERY body. Just suck it in and continue to do what you have to do; THAT is where the strength lies, not in pretending defiance at the mere hint of another trying to make light the situation, which they probably are doing to make YOU feel better and realize how infinitesimal and pointless your gargantuan \'issues\' are.
The weather\'s turned, and the old neighbors creep out from their crammed rooms to blink in the sun, as if surprised to find they\'ve lived through another winter.  Though steam heat\'s left them pale and shrunken like old root vegetables, Mr. and Mrs. Tozzi are already hard at work on their front-yard mini-Sicily: a Virgin Mary birdbath, a thicket of roses, and the only outdoor aloes in Manhattan. It\'s the old immigrant story, the beautiful babies grown up into foreigners. Nothing\'s turned out the way they planned as sweethearts in the sinks of Palermo. Still, each waves a dirt-caked hand in geriatric fellowship with Stanley, the former tattoo king of the Merchant Marine, turning the corner with his shaggy collie, who\'s hardly three but trots arthritically in sympathy. It\'s only the young who ask if life\'s worth living, notMrs. Sansanowitz, who for the last hour has been inching her way down the sidewalk, lifting and placing her new aluminum walker as carefully as a spider testing its web. On days like these, I stand for a long time under the wild gnarled root of the ancient wisteria, dry twigs that in a week will manage a feeble shower of purple blossom, and I believe it: this is all there is, all history\'s brought us here to our only life to find, if anywhere, our hanging gardens and our street of gold: cracked stoops, geraniums, fire escapes, these old stragglers basking in their bit of sun.
Wow...has three years already passed??  Neither of us can believe it.  It seems like yesterday that we just met.  It\'s unimaginable the love we share.  Regardless of our past and present we look on to the future as a family.  I admit, we didn\'t know each other for too long until we just clicked.  We saw each other\'s pain and mended it.  We are each other\'s missing piece in the most uncomprehensible  jigsaw puzzle fitting right into place.  We\'ve had our fights, but we learn from them and grow stronger.  We have our special moments and grow stronger.  We discuss everything and hide nothing and grow stronger. Everyone tells him how lucky he is to have me at his side, but yet they don\'t understand that I am incredibly lucky to have him at my side.  Alex is the type of guy that every guy wishes they could be and that every girl would want.  Sure he has his downfalls, but if you don\'t accept them and help your love up, that is your downfall.  We have shared our past to each other and our ex\'s, but together we laugh and say how far we\'ve come to finally meet the right person to wake up to and enjoy life with.  There is no better way to grow but through experience and communication with no restraints.  No lies, no hi,\'en messages.  Just straight forward truth and compassion. We are always supportive of each other through whatever endeavor.  If we disagree, we discuss; and from that we understand each others points and come to conclusion. I\'m not materialistic like his past relations and that\'s what he loves.  I keep him happy as any woman should to his man.  We are our own person and there is no better way to be expressed.  I\'m quite a goofy one so it always makes him smile.  Seeing him smile is such a joy it makes me smile.  Now we have Sasha as well and she just helps us grow even more closer.  His mother and I adore each other and confide in each other so dearly.  We are the best of friends.  Our small family may be small, but in our hearts we are as big and robust as the night time sky if not more.  Three years have just gone by so fast.....We all await for what the future holds for us as our love grows stronger.
After college and getting settled in a new job I decided that it was time for a new chapter in life. So I moved into my very own place. Yes 23 and just moving out. I knew this would be a very difficult move because I had never even stayed overnight away from home but maybe 3 times. Boy was I right! So I called in for reinforcements. Jodi and Kristy to save the day. We all needed to get away for our own reasons so this was the perfect time. We would watch Tom Cruise movies and eat popcorn until we got sick. Painting the house was a damn good time considering that none of us was 100% sure of what was going on. Thank God  for family. Who knows what that place would have looked like. After the newest wore off and everybody got into something else, there I was all alone again. I still had family but I needed someone. So I had lost some weight and was feeling pretty good about myself so I called up Jodi and told her we needed to get together. She had been through a divorce recently so she was ready.
I do not seem to be able to stay current with anything lately and blogging has been the worst. I am trying to keep up with assignments in my Web Design class, keep my lia sophia business afloat, which means calls and organization and keeping up with paper work, trying to keep my house clean and attempting to get some long overdue redecorating done. Which brings me to this picture?  Remember when my son moved home for 6 months and we repainted his room in the color of his choice? Well this room is now my office (with another cardboard creation homework assignment from Sadie\'s art teacher stored here). It is BRIGHT! Not in a good way.
I don\'t want to admit how long it took me to figure out what these are called. As soon as I figured it out I sai,\',\'uh, I knew that.\'Sea Urchins, or Echinoids (dead), in case you were wondering. I\'m glad I saved some poor soul the time searching on Google for\'round, hollow sea creature\', or\'spherical sea creature\'or\'circular coral reef animal\', because I certainly did not spend a lot of time doing the same thing, nope, not me.  And now that I am done wasting time on the internet looking up round sea animals I will now go waste more time on the internet stalking people on Facebook.  This has been a public service announcement brought to you by a procrastinating graduate student that just wants to go home right now. Have a nice day :)
Then there was my life, which had fallen apart. All I was left with was the thought that I has tried, really tried and nothing in my life worked and my psychic pain was worse. God, I thought was either ignoring me or he just did not think I had prayed the right prayers, thought the right thoughts, gone to church enough, repented enough, suffered enough, believed enough, done enough, or was just not good enough. And I was very, very angry at Him.  After awhile I gave up and recently decided that I would try to fix me, to save me myself. Then I gave up on God again. And it has been wonderful. My therapist is helping me find hope in, to accept, to connect with, to believe in, myself. I have reached points where I just want to crawl out of my hole and join a wonderful world. When I have those moments where I can\'t take \'it,\' where my childhood demons overwhelm me and I want to get away, I retreat into my room, but I don\'t want to crawl in a hole anymore. I am open to the ideal that there is indeed something \'else.\' Something nurturing, kind, loving, in this universe but I am looking for that within myself.
She loves to wear dresses while she plays trains and cars. She tromps through the mud in her pink tights. Rarely leaves the house without a necklace or bracelet, but runs faster than the boys and hasn\'t met a jungle gym she can\'t conquer, even at 2 3/4.  The day I snapped this shot with my phone, we spent quite a bit of time shoe shopping, just for fun. She loves red heels, just like I do. (I would have bought these, but they were too big for both of us.) We giggled and pranced in the isles of Ross, trying on silly shoes we didn\'t need just because it was fun and they were really inexpensive, anyway.  I am so proud of my little girl. She is her Grandma Judeen\'s gran,\'aughter. I have no doubt that she, too, will be bailing hay in a miniskirt or stomping across the cow pasture without looking down, perfectly accessorized.
I get so emotional and then I laugh, we humans are really something. I can enjoy reading debates on subjects that I have no opinion about but when it comes to subjects where I have choosen a point of view that is very deep in my heart I shun away and I can\'t continue reading. I do not want to comment.  Right now people are fighting for the right to home school in Sweden, as some religious family made some bad choices based on their beliefs. There is an article about how children learn(link below) that I agree with. I wish I had the chance to live like this when I was young. I sometimes do not understand my own children¥s choices to attend school and all the things (restrictions) that goes with that.  Freedom for me is so important but I will respect my children¥s choices now as well as when they grow up. Although every now and then (too often, Elena says) I ask if she wants to quit school and I reminded her how nice it was before school. FYI Elena started school when she was 9, and I am happy she waited that long at least.  Anyway I am getting lots of emails from the Swedish homeschooling group about articles and ofcourse there is lots of comments on the subject. Some are so uphauling that it is just amazing to me how we as humans can have such extreme opposite beliefs. But that is really okay. What turns my stomach is how people can judge and condemn others for their beliefs. Well, I was just in the mi,\'le of it today and did not feel so good. I know it can be lonely to be a warrior (my favorite definition, from Stuart Wild, I mean different from mass consciousness) but it sure is worth it.
The world is full of some beautiful souls, and it surely seems that Olivier Dupon from Dossier37 is one of them. He is known to many Sydneysiders for his gorgeous shop Lola Et Moi, which he ran for about three years, and now the rest of the world is getting to know his quirky, colourful and inspired ways through his blog Dossier37. Olivier kindly shared these pics with Daily Imprint of his home in Pyrmont. As he describes it,\'Great views, great light... We use the flat as a white blank canvas for our collections of antique and modern artworks and designer pieces.
Born in Brooklyn and now living in the not so wide open spaces of NJ. I have a 35 year old son - yes I was a knocked up teen - he and his wife share a Mother/Daughter type home with me. I run my own business - used to have an office but now work out of home. I often work a second job to pay for Internet service. I have 2 rescued cats.
I have become just a little bit wrapped up in this weight loss process and all the new things I am discovering about me, my habits around food, alternative forms of exercise, and life in general.  I have shared all of my thoughts with you on this blog but I really don\'t want this blog to be a weight loss blog.    I started Living The Life Of Tere to be about my life, my family, my thoughts.  Me, Me, Me.  Weight loss is a part of my life but it is not the only part of me.  But I had things I wanted to share with others about weight loss, things that have helped friends and others.  I started to put off writing here about some funny things my kids did and other stories so I could post some weight loss stories.  That\'s not really where I wanted things to go.  I decided I needed to compartmentalize my life a bit when it comes to sharing my life with others.  So I did something that makes no sense with the small amount of time I have . . . I started a separate weight loss blog.  One where I can share my thoughts on weight loss, food diary, successes and failures, low calorie recipes, tips and tricks from others, reviews of products, other people\'s success stories . . . for those that are interested in that type of thing.
We were friends along the way, sharing postcards, phone calls, fudge, pasta developed for diabetics, and videos of Bill the dog. We figured out ways to get along regardless of our differences.   You were part of my life for over two years and now you are gone. No more\'yer\'this and\'yer\'that. No more emails outside of MySpace, that most others knew nothing about. I always appreciated your consideration for my feelings.  When we first met, sometime in 2007 or 2008, you didn\'t think you would live until Christmas of that year. But you did. Count that as extra gravy. But I know it hasn\'t been easy extra time. With all my heart, I hope you just went to sleep the other night and never woke up.   Sleep well with peaceful dreams, Sweetpea. We won\'t forget you.
Where I come from it\'s .  A small island of the coast of North Carolina called \'Cape Hatteras Islan,\'d known for the tallest Lighthouse in our nation. It\'s also known for its beaches, white sands, surfing waves, and it\'s treacherous Diamond Shoals. It has a very rich, full history in many areas of our past; wars, pirates, and tourism. Many stories fill my head and my heart over flows with the memories I myself have on that little sandy beach I called home for most of my life.   My family moved to Cape Hatteras when I was a very young girl, I believe I began the 3rd grade there on the island. We moved across the states from Bremerton Washington with my father\'s job in the US Navy. Of course moving to the island at that time brought great change in my life and back then it truly was just a little island, full of mom and pop shops and restaurants, little tourism, and 1 full military base.  As a child our days were spent; playing with the neighboring children, playing in the park, or making a trip over the dunes to play at the beach. In many ways it was ideal yet in today\'s society by many standards it would be considered lacking on so many levels.
The other day I was so lucky as to be able to spend time at one of my favorite places. It\'s a place I hope to spend the vast majority of my summer. (Second to work, I suppose, but let\'s not think about that now) Shortly after arriving, I ran into a friend and inquired as to his well being.  He replie,\'dOh, perfect! If I won the lottery, it\'d be a step down!\'I love it. I feel the same way, surrounded by such awesome people in my life.
Hospital waiting rooms have wi-fi now. Isn\'t that great? And it\'s noisy in here. I didn\'t expect that. We are swapping stories about my MIL who has not been married to my FIL for years. MIL travels with food. Half-eaten food. Want some coffee cake? I couldn\'t leave it behind, it was so good. That kind of thing.  My SIL is here in Dayton from Madison, WI. Other SIL, from Chicago, will come in later this week, tag team hospital visits. The plan, medico-wise, is to remove a goodly portion of FILs left lung, and follow up with chemotherapy. Because he actually has a chance to survive this thing, FIL has quit smoking. So far, anyway. His wife is working on it. SIL from Madison will be taking regular smoke-breaks during the day.   We are working on our explorations of the kitchen-infested, extended-stay hotels in the south Dayton area. Last night\'s was not as nice as the last one we stayed in, but it was fifty bucks cheaper for the night. So there\'s that. And I am never one to pass up a free breakfast.  The back pain is subsiding, which is good. I am being very careful with it, to maintain. Thanks to everyone for all your good wishes, both for me and for Husband\'s dad. If the waiting gets long or boring, I\'ll hop on and write some more, and I\'ll post any updates we hear. For now I\'ll post because I am a total comment whore. Shut up. No wait. Don\'t shut up. I mean shut up about me being a comment whore.  I think I\'ve had too much coffee this morning.
How do you deal with grief? i found myself crying last night as i watched a tv show and one of the main characters painfully re-entered the same location where her daughter was su,\'enly taken from her. it reminded me of the night my puppy chucky was taken. now i know an animal can\'t really be compared to a human loss but my little puppy was my angel, my shadow and my baby. i still grieve over the loss and i still see the accident in my head on a regular basis. So this wont get me any fans but i am a self proclaimed high school bully, i am not ashamed of it because it is how i survived high school. i didn\'t bully every one i just picked on certain people and most of the time it was retaliation for shit they had already done to me.  but since school has finished i left my bullying days behind me, i left every one alone. So my question tonight is how do you deal with people who you cant really get rid of? The current pain in my ass happens to be my boyfriends best friends partner so i cant really stomp on her and then scrape her off the bottom of my shoe.
There are many things in life that make me happy. Little things, things that just make me smile. One of my favorites is Post Secret Sundays. Post Secret is a project started a few years ago by a man named Frank. Frank left a few postcards in a few public places with simple instructions. Write a secret on it, decorate it if you like, and send it in, anonymously, to the a,\'ress already written on the card. It grew into quite a phenomena. Now, Frank gets postcards from all over the world. He\'s compiled them and published more than one book. And every Sunday, Frank posts a new set of secrets on postsecret.com. Even with the books and the website, only a fraction of the secrets are viewed.  Every Sunday, I log on to my computer, excited to see the new secrets. It\'s a simple pleasure that I truly enjoy. The secrets are often sad, sometimes disturbing, occasionally funny, but always insightful.  Everyone has secrets. Little secrets, like you really don\'t like your friend\'s new haircut. Unimportant secrets, like it was you who ate all the blueberries(an actual secret that made me laugh out loud). And big, important secrets, ones you don\'t even dare think about for fear of inexplicably blurting out loud simply from the weight of it.
Woke up around 11 am and realised that I most likely was DYING. The horror...! THE HORROR...! It should be said that I deal with illness like a man, an over-dramatic man. So I phoned my doctor, seeing as I\'m Stockholm-bound for Friday and didn\'t feel like suffering from intense ear-ache on my flight. Managed to eat an apple. One apple a day does NOT keep the doctor away. Walking to the doctors it was hard not to feel gi,\'y though (in spite of my case of the DEATH). It was so sunny and warm, flowers everywhere and I could really feel how this was it. Winter is well and truly over! Bumped in to my friend Nat, out for some fresh air with a friend. Nat was equally ill, and her friend had tonsillitis. Poor us. Walking back home from the doctors I spotted this book in the Childrens Bookshop in Bruntsfield. I had to stop and buy it for my own (not so) hugless Douglas. You can see part of his hairy leg in the picture above. The likeness with a fussy bear is striking. My new be,\'ing was delivered! Ooooh, all white, crisp and new! Sat on it with Doris the ukulele for a while, feeling all summery and happy.
That one day, the world will change, and people will start realizing how beautiful life really is. I pray that one day the world will be rid of liars, cheaters, and thieves. &if not rid of, than those people will see that their actions actually do affect others. I pray that their eyes will be opened, and they will start to feel the way that God feels toward His children. I pray for the rid of ignorance and foolishness. I pray for the rid of selfishness. I pray that God\'s hands will protect the hearts of the ones who live for Him, and pity those who never believed. I pray that God will bless those in need of strength and courage. I pray no punishment. But I do pray for the people who need to get what they deserve. I pray that people who don\'t care, will start to. And people who do care get what they need out of everything. Life isn\'t about wanting things for yourself. It\'s about loving those who you easily provide for. Materials are nothing without the feeling of loving what you have. The thankful feeling you receive when blessed by things that you love. I pray that anger will be lifted off of my shoulders. I pray that God will give me the strength to lift my head up and walk with positive energy. I pray that God will give me the strength to forgive those who I feel I cannot forgive, and help those to forgive me for the wrongs I\'ve caused upon them. &I pray, that one day God will help me believe that this is all worth it, and happiness is really obtainable.
Today was one of those I should really get up and do something, but I don\'t wanna kind of days! So I didn\'t! I Hung out with my wonderful husband and sweet kids.   Poor Hunter came home from his sleepover really sick. As soon as he walked in our front door I knew he was sick! Then I felt him and I he said\'Mom, I feel terrible.\'He broke my heart. He is running a fever and has a bad cough. If I don\'t see an improvement in him by tomorrow, I\'m going to take him to the ER. Hunter is so thin and frail as it is because he isn\'t the best eater, so we kind of panic when he gets sick at all.  Anyway, other then Hunter being sick, our weekend is lazy and good! I like it when Mark is off work and the kids are home from school and we can all just be together. Our weekdays are so crazy and busy, so the weekends are a time to be together.  Everyone is gathered around the t.v. right now watching America\'s Most Wanted. Okay, I know not the best family show, but we all love COPS and America\'s Most Wanted and we never miss it on Saturday night.
Alex is now 3.5 months old and doing great. He has found his hands and they are normally in his mouth. He is great at assisted standing and sitting. He has all kinds of sounds. Goo, hoo, oooh and ahhh. Bouncing in the bath is his favorite activity. His friends Elliott (Zoe\'s brother) and Maude (Max\'s sister) were born at the end of November. So they are only a couple of months be hind him. Max had his second birthday right after Christmas. We got to see him open on present. Nathan helped with the rest. Alex loves to be held when awake. As soon as he is sleeping he wants to be put down in a quiet place. As far as sleep he does ok. Currently he is sleeping from 9pm-1am and then up again at 4 and 6 or 7. This would be fine with me but Nathan has been getting up at 3. Make for a long morning.
Ok so you know how when you to anywhere they want to know what you\'re allergic to? Well my answer was always nothing. But now I have an answer. Anything in the Factive family. It took two trips to the hospital and alot of itching to figure it out. I have a few pictures in the\'people you know abulm\'for you to see but man it\'s a you had to of been there kind of thing. But with the great nurse I have helping me with my oatmeal baths and slathering down of the old sticky lotion I\'ll make it through just fine. Man you got to love a good nurse!  2-9-08 You know I\'m still not sure that I was having a reaction. I have had sooo many kids with the same rash at school. Poor kids!
I love The Biggest Loser and believe it can truly motivate people to get help when they can\'t figure out how to help themselves but the contestants get bigger and their stories sa,\'er each season. All fat people are not sad. Some of us have dated and been loved and really like ourselves but want to live healthy, active lives so we change our bad habits and work hard to get rid of the weight we so blindly allowed to take over. But people need to realize that being skinny is a lot like winning the lottery. It\'s great and some things are easier but all your emotional issues are still there until you DO something about them.   Maybe self-confidence really WAS my problem. I was ok, my life was ok. I was happy. So I never did anything about the weight that kept creeping on. I have done something about it several times over the last few years but really only half-heartedly, because I felt like I SHOULD. But I am doing it this time and I am very serious about it.
I just love and cherish the place where I was born because I am a friend, cousin, niece and gran,\'aughter of people who reside in Israel. I also happen to LOVE the scenery, food, and environment of my homeland. Fine, so I lied a bit. I would hate to see Israel non-existent or unrecognized. Which definitely means I am NOT anti-Israel. I\'m also pro-peace. Glad we got that out of the way...  A little history on how I got into this whole pro-Israel mess: I was born in Rishon Le-Tzion, Israel. I lived there until I was eight, except for a brief year when my parents decided to venture off to Hong Kong and get all these stamps on my passport from all of Eastern Asia. Too bad all I have is the passport... I moved to the Silicon Valley where I only started to value and recognize my Israeli identity in high school. I got really involved in a youth group called Tzofim, and dreamed of joining the Israel Defense Forces after high school as early as freshman year. I spent every summer vacation in Israel during my high school years. Summers were all I looked forward to. Did I mention the Silicon Valley has a huge Israeli community? Well this was a huge factor for my ability to stay connected to my culture instead of diving into the big melting pot of american society.  Well as it turns out, there aren\'t many Israelis in San Diego, where I go to school. Thus, when looking to get involved with the Israeli community at UCSD, I was right away pointed to the direction of Israel advocacy. This is where this whole pro/anti thing comes in. Israel advocacy is basically feeding everyone and their mom the greatness of Israel through it\'s diversity, innovations, and did I mention- it is the only democracy in the mi,\'le east? It\'s making sure Jews are pro-Israel and non-Jews are simply not anti. Sometimes, I feel as if it one big brainwash. But I live for it.  So. I\'m going to Israel this summer simply to enjoy every beautiful (and humid) moment.
I am at the beach on Spring Break.  Not my Spring Break but my daughter\'s.  Several months ago, Daughter and her friends decided they were going to the beach for Spring Break.  They planned, they analyzed, they researched then realized that they needed someone older to rent a place and it was going to take a lot more money than they thought.  So they invited the Moms.    Don\'t get me wrong . . . I don\'t feel used.  How many 20 year olds would even consider taking their moms along with them on Spring Break?  We are actually quite honored.  And we are having fun.
What if you could have forty million dollars completely tax free... but you could never spend more than two days in the same city. This means that you\'d have to move all your stuff every two days.    You could rotate cities, but you\'d have to put three cities in between every rotation.    So if you wanted to go back to whatever city you\'re from you would have to make sure you stayed six days at three other cities before going back.  Would you take the money and resign yourself to the life of a nomad or would you stay put and live where you wanted for however long you wanted?  I don\'t know what I\'d do.  If I took the money I\'d definitely invest in an rv.  i don\'t know if I could do that forever though.  Not having to work ever would be nice, but I may want to stay somewhere sometimes.    What would you do?
I am a sucker for a Liberty print. I still have several items, including a paisley bag, which I bought from the store when I used to live in London. So it\'s no surprise that I like these pretty - in a old-fashioned yet contemporary way - baby clothes from Elki. It was started by sisters Emma and Georgina who grew up in a creative home. Emma went on to study visual communication and become a graphic designer while Georgina studied fashion. Emma lives in central west NSW while Georgie is based in Bowral. The sisters import the fabric from Liberty of London and design and make the products themselves.
I love the atmosphere the olympics are stirring up in my city. I love how I can get downtown after a 20 minute bus ride and experience granville street at its best. The colours, smells, sounds and feelings of patriotism breathes Vancouver new life. Nightlife is more expensive, but hey, it\'s a great time to be barely legal. With the exception of day one (and today), our city has been enjoying some of the best weather it\'s seen in February.   Things haven\'t been perfect though. With the tragic death of the Georgian luger on day 1, the untimely death of Canadian figure skater Joannie Rochette\'s mother, unseasonal, warm weather, the disappointment of some Canadian medal hopefuls...and not to mention the failure to bring the fourth pillar up for the opening ceremonies (lol, FAIL) we\'ve been good sports. We\'re handling it well. The enthusiasm for the games is contagious.
weird\'let\'s discuss what this word means to us. to me it\'s one of the most positive words i know. i think i generally use it to replace\'interesting\'but after trying to convince a guy the other night that me calling him\'weird\'was a massive compliment, i realized i might be alone in this. i am completely attracted to things and people that are curiously bizarre. things i don\'t quite understand but that none the less, peak my interest. i think most people i know feel the same way but whenever i use the word with a big smile on my face, i get the o,\'est looks. i also tend to take it as a compliment when i\'m called\'weird\', even though i\'m sure it\'s often not meant that way :)  google image\'weird\'and this is the first thing that comes up. see how great it is?
I like...flipping my blankets over to the cold side when I sleep, the smell of sun-dried laundry, back scratches, food, the winter\'s first snowfall, beach days, wallowing in music on a gloomy, wet vancouver day, crazy moments with people that I am crazy for, nail polish, avocados, big warm hugs, large meadows that are frolick-a-ble, the summertime, qoola, french, leggings, tea, metal water bottles, school supply shopping, salmon cream cheese, and some days more than others - stepping out of my comfort zone.
It\'s been more than a month since I posted anything here. There is so much to do, plus my mood has been off. But I am finding myself really missing the journaling aspect of blogging, especially therapeutic journaling. Blogger, heal thyself!  I have a week\'s (unpaid) vacation from my job, and today I am cleaning house as I work on my to-do list. Sewing, decorating, and gardening are how I would most like to spend this time. More moving-in and organizing have to be on the plan as well. Some priorities are (bleh!) taxes and fencing (*sigh*) to keep the boy dogs from fighting.   Dunno why, but I DID NOT EXPECT THIS!! Harley is not the simple laid-back, big squishy te,\'y bear he appears to be, and has now decided to make his move for dominance. Or is it his intention to completely eliminate the competition? I can\'t tell. As he grew much larger than Frankie, he began to show a little more aggression in regard to being close to his people and being first for treats. Less than a week after his neutering, we had an incident over a collar and leash they both wanted (to them, these evidently mean being singled out for special treatment) and ended up with a badly wounded Frankie, and also a wounded Mama (me). Poking your finger into a fighting St. Bernard\'s mouth is not the best idea for breaking his hold. Four days later my fingers on the other hand were also injured and Frankie\'s wounds were opened, and I learned that this was not something we were going to be able to put behind us for a long time, if ever.  One of the happiest parts of my daily life has been sharing it with my three dogs, so you can imagine how bummed I am feeling. At all times, one of them must be either outside, in the laundry room, or in the crate. Coordinating their quality time inside and out is very unsatisfying for all and very time-consuming for me. We did find a really good article on this type of aggression, which has given us some hope, and our next plan is to install a good gate in the mi,\'le of the house and to create a separation of yards outside. Otherwise, we will have to find Harley a new home where he can be the only dog, without competition for affection and attention.  Damn.
Finally! I got a full day\'s work done. Almost 4k, and if my hand hadn\'t started hurting I would have gotten even more done.  There\'s nothing I hate more than wanting to go go go and my body won\'t let me. Grr. But I\'m finally past the three-quarter mark on Hecate\'s Own and I\'m about to write the big showdown, save-the-day scene, after which there will be food, sex, and more food, knowing Zach. Once that\'s done, it\'s time for the Meat Grinder and the Beta Readers while I switch gears and begin serious work on Norwegian Wood.  I keep thinking I\'m missing something, though. Something important. Hopefully it will come out in the Meat Grinder and I\'ll slap myself silly, fix it and move on. If not, my Betas will find it, slap me silly, and I\'ll fix it and move on.  I haven\'t gotten the artwork yet on Mating Games, and I\'m still waiting for word on Noble Blood, but I knew I would be. Laurie was swamped with Red Hot Fairy Tale submissions, so for everyone who\'s waiting to hear the fate of Duncan, Jaden and Moira hopefully I\'ll have word no later than the end of April.  Oh! And if you\'ve emailed me and I haven\'t responded, please email me again! I\'ve been so caught up I may have missed it. Our oldest graduates grade school this year, we\'re planning a trip to Disney and I\'ve got RT coming up, so when I\'m able to sit at the computer I\'ve been concentrating a lot on that stuff since writing wasn\'t much of an option the last few weeks.  I know. Bad author. No cookie for me.  P.S. Samhain Publishing is hosting the second annual Sammie Awards at the Samhain Cafe this Sunday! I\'ll be there if I have to sit Dusty down and make HIM type for me! Hope to see you there!
Oh friends, it\'s finally here! I thought the month between Christmas break and midwinter break wouldn\'t be too slow and awful. I told myself I wouldn\'t take any days off, and I succeeded in that. There was a pretty rough stretch for a bit, though, with that bunch of teachers leaving.  Loud Leo left our class a few weeks ago. A new boy came to the class, but has apparently left again. Buster, whom I have not yet mentioned, has remained a serious detriment to the class\'s focus and my patience (or lack thereof). Buster refuses to control himself most of the time. It\'s \'just\' his mouth, but that means that when the rest of the class is quiet, he makes noise and distracts them and then never shuts up. And then other boys follow his lead and make more noise. GAH. He\'s really started to haunt me.  We had a party on Friday, that I\'m not totally certain they deserved, but lord knows it had to be better than trying to force them to learn on the Friday afternoon before a week off. Our last lesson of the day was writing Valentine acrostics. About half of kids basically did nothing, but the rest did a poem, and a few of them turned out pretty well actually.  Anyway....we\'re here! Vacation! A whole week off! My favorite part is always the not waking up before dawn. Also the not being at school for so many hours. I didn\'t bring anything home with me, but I will go in for a few hours next week to work on unit planning. I\'ve been behind for so long but too exhausted to do anything about it. I hope to remedy that, at least a little for now.  Also, happy Valentine\'s Day today! The boy and I had a wonderful day together, out and about.
