<s> Introducing Cole Isaac Gilbert The baby is here Thanks to everyone who has helped out in the past few weeks especially those guest posters I 'll continue to be on semi-maternity leave over the next few weeks but I wanted to share the good news and my birth story for those interested Cheers Christine Cole Isaac Gilbert Born <date> 9 50 PM 8 lbs 12 oz 21 inches long 'The Cure ' I had breezed past my due date and by Friday my midwife wanted me to get an ultrasound to make sure the baby was still thriving in his post <math> week world We were planning a homebirth a carefully weighed decision based in part on the nearly perfect health I had been experiencing throughout the pregnancy and my strong desire to avoid a c-section especially since we would be birthing in the <smiley> where c-section rates top <math> <s> It is not a choice for everyone but we were well-educated about the options and it felt right That afternoon I ate lunch and headed over to the ultrasound appointment Drew and I sat in silence as the tech tried to jiggle our baby into movement The bio physical scan scored the baby based on 4 types of movement from rolling over to 'practice breathing ' Our score Zero I drank some juice I poked the baby and wiggled my abs After 30 minutes our midwife transferred us to the hospital for more tests The baby wasn 't moving Remember that perfectly healthy pregnancy I talked about Well apparently on Week 40 Day 4 I developed pregnancy induced hypertension Normally you 'd see this after the six month point when the women is blood pressure starts to creep up and her kidneys begin dropping protein into the urine and her feet and hands might get really swollen According to the blood work I had moved past that first stage of just hypertension beyond mild pre-eclampsia and was now looking at some of the scarier effects like my kidneys not working correctly blood clotting issues and potential seizures when blood pressure in a pregnant women gets too high they don 't stroke out they have a seizure fun fact The cure The doctor sat down and tried to couch it as nicely as possible 'The only cure is to have this baby ' We didn 't freak out in fact we were very calm about the matter We spent about 30 minutes quizzing the doctor on the relative merits of induction verses cesarean the likelihood of success based on cervical favorably bishop score and methods used and ultimately what did he think was the safest for everyone involved 'If it was my wife or daughter A c-section ' I think everyone the doctor nurses and midwife included were a bit surprised when we said 'Okay ' Maybe they expected us to fight it to try to come up with some way to birth at home or to take the insane risk of disregarding the medical advice we had been given But to us a home birth was about safety not about some ego-driven one upmanship over our child-bearing peers A low risk healthy birth is safest when left alone but all of that goes out of the window once there is complications If you are sick if your baby is at risk you want a doctor there That is why we did the tests and ultrasounds to rule out anything that would cause us problems down the road Well it worked I signed the paperwork and they prepped me for surgery I won 't go into too much detail about the actual surgery as it is not pleasant You wouldn 't expect it to be I am sure but I might have of had a slightly harder time than other women as the spinal made me extremely sick There is one moment I 'll always remember though and it is the single bright spot in the experience I was gasping for breath from beneath the sickly plasticy smelling oxygen mask with my own vomit drying on my face and in my hair trying to not succumb again and I heard my baby is first cry I couldn 't have been further from the moment forgetting completely why I was subjecting myself to this and his piercing scream pulled me right back I burst into tears and felt this clear indescribable joy Afterward I got everything I wanted Cole was alert and latched an hour after surgery when they stabilized me enough to permit breastfeeding I stayed up with him most of the night marveling his perfect little features the way he pouted my husband says he gets this from me and the way his breathing gets excited as he gets close to me I had spent all this time planning the perfect birth and I got almost none of my wishes except one A healthy baby Later I would tell Drew that the disappointment the anger the sadness of having our plans dashed would take time to heal Really though it hasn 't been time the cure has been Cole Being with him has been so opposite so perfectly wonderful it is redemptive I feel like I won the baby lottery

<s> When I am with a friend we talk <s> A walk is a walk is a walk until I walked with Claire The girl doesn 't know it but she always knows exactly what to do and say to put things in perspective This morning we decided to walk uptown to the post office and library <s> She put on her Dora sneakers and tan jacket and I surprised her with new purple mittens with hearts and rainbows I bought her on winter clearance <s> This made her very happy I put on my pink backpack loaded with the envelopes that needed to be mailed my phone and some money since I was pretty sure I had library fines to reconcile <s> Claire put on her Dora backpack The weather was lovely sunny and about 40 degrees when we started walking <s> Sidewalks are inconsistent for the first few blocks so we cut down an alley to avoid street traffic <s> As we passed a garage Claire asked 'Where 'd my shadow go ' 'What honey ' I asked She stopped 'My shadow Grammy ' Shadow But of course I haven 't thought about my shadow since I was a kid except to maybe avoid looking at it when I was obese 'It is hi 'en by the garage ' I told her 'Let is move back into the sunshine ' 'There it is It is big ' she said 'You have a big shadow too Grammy ' and she waved 'See my hand ' I waved back with both hands <s> She giggled 'I see your fingers in the shadow ' she said When we turned the corner we were back on a sidewalk and our shadows were in front of us <s> Claire hopped over each crack for the rest of the block thrilled that her shadow kept up with her We got to a corner at which we had to cross a street <s> I was holding her hand and was just going to walk her across when it dawned on me that I could teach her how to properly cross a street 'Always stop before walking out on to the street ' I said 'Look to your left <s> Do you see a car coming ' Looking very concentrated she peered down the street 'No ' she said seriously 'Now look to your right <s> Any cars ' 'Nope ' 'OK that means we can cross safely ' We walked down a street I 've walked for years but I 'd never really noticed that the Purinton is house was blue or the rental next door had green trim until Claire pointed it out <s> Then she spied tiny purple flowers in the next yard ' <repeatedchars> Those are crocuses ' I told her 'Crocheches ' she repeated <s> Close enough I wouldn 't have noticed them on an ordinary walk <s> I notice them in my own yard because I am looking for them but crocuses are even better when you 're not seeking them out and spectacular when you unexpectedly get to introduce them to a 2-year-old who loves the colors purple and green 'I run real fast Grammy ' and she took off <s> I kept up by walking more briskly but it was fun to let her get to the next house a little before I did We were getting close to another corner and she took my hand <s> We stopped she looked both ways and we walked safely across We went to the post office first which is next door to the library <s> I handed the envelopes to the mail clerk <s> Claire said 'I want to see ' so I lifted her up to sit on the counter 'I like your mittens ' said the clerk <s> Claire is shy and so she just smiled and looked down at the hearts and rainbows 'Can she have a lollipop ' he whispered to me <s> I no 'ed 'Would you like a lollipop ' he asked Claire 'Yes ' she said rather boldly and I thought Yeah I 've always preferred candy over compliments too She reached in the bag and pulled out a small chocolate flavored Tootsie-Pop <s> She is definitely my gran 'aughter 'What do you say ' I asked her 'Thank you ' she said staring at her mittens again but he heard her 'You 're welcome ' he said She insisted I open the wrapper before we left the post office and I didn 't want her to bring it into the library so we sat on a bench out front and she ate her lollipop 'A black truck ' she pointed to the street 'That is Papa is truck ' Her dad is dad is Papa and drives a pickup 'No that is not Papa is truck but it looks like it ' I said 'That is a red car ' she continued and crunched her lollipop 'Hear that ' she asked 'That is a blue jay ' I said 'Blue jay ' she repeated and took another bite of her lollipop Watching Claire observe the world around her the world I 've very much taken for granted this Ting-Tings song came into my head They call me girl They call me Stacey They call me her They call me Jane That is not my

<s> Beyond Getting There What Travel Days Show <smiley> Today is guest post is by Gillian at One-Giant-Step com sums up for me that imperceptible change that happens when you travel you start appreciating things you never thought you would In that process maybe you even learn a new way to see the world Who is it that said 'It is not about the destination it is about the journey ' Nine months of full time traveling has proven to me that this is absolutely true Before leaving on this trip the thought of an 8 or 10 hour bus trip was pretty daunting <s> The longest trips we 'd taken were on planes where they serve drinks and meals and we can pass the time watching movies <s> Eight hours on a bus without the same amenities sounded like torture but we jumped in right from the start with a 22 hour ride from Lima to Cusco that while not the most comfortable ride got us into the swing of things pretty quickly Once we got a routine down snacks packed books prepared podcasts ready and had determined our favorite seats on the drivers side no window bar blocking the view no children nearby bus journeys became easy and now travel days are some of my favorite days They are a chance for quiet reflection to leave behind what is past to think about the place we are leaving and start thinking about how we will remember our experiences there that great evening we had at the market the interesting people we met at the cooking course the horrible bed at the guesthouse <s> They are a chance to look forward to anticipate what is coming and to plan ahead where will we go next how will we get there where will we stay <s> They are a chance to stare out the window and think about where we 've been and where we 're going about past successes and future plans when else is there a chance to do nothing but quietly think Travel days let us learn a little bit about the people and culture of the places we visit <s> Sitting in an airport bus station or train depot gives me a great vantage point to see how people relate to each other <s> Who is traveling with who Where might they be going and why Are they traveling for work or holiday or to visit family Who are they meeting or leaving behind In a small northern Turkish town we witnessed a heart-wrenching goodbye between two young men <s> Turkish men are very close - it is normal to see them holding hands and embracing each other and this couple seemed heartbroken to be leaving each other <s> One boy sat in the seat ahead of us perhaps on his way to school or military service his friend stood outside the bus <s> They spent their remaining time together with hands pressed against the glass trying to talk through the window and texting each other on their phones <s> I don 't understand Turkish but is was clear they were going to miss each other terribly I like the act of traveling the moving forward the getting somewhere <s> I love watching the scenery slowly change from rolling hills to flat plains along high twisty mountain roads or perfectly straight desert highways there is always lots to see <s> One of my favorite bus rides is still that first 22 hour ride between Lima and Cusco <s> I will always remember dawn breaking over the altiplano the smoke rising from the llama herder shacks and the sun glinting off the frost that covered the ground There are plenty of stories to be told about dodgy bus trips or awful plane rides or the never-ending tuk tuk minivan bus boat combination what would we do without those stories But there are also plenty of journeys that are made perfectly lovely the lemon spritz on Turkish buses the meals served on Argentinean buses or the comfy bed on the overnight Thailand train Travel days are an integral part of travel <s> They are filled with possibility and anticipation of what lies ahead <s> I like the optimism they have the sense that fun and adventure lie ahead <s> No matter how long or short the journey they will always be my favorites

<s> History waiting to repeat - The family visit to Agra last week was for the benefit of my two young nephews aged 9 and 7 years who had never seen the Taj <s> Strangely the visit for me turned out to be a morose one <s> The Taj did not seem as splendorous as it used to <s> The grandeur of its marble seemed to have been visibly effected presumably by pollution since I last saw it around two and half years ago <s> The badly lit inside was depressing and too claustrophobic <s> The too well known story of 22 <date> craftsmen having their hands cut off upon the orders of the Emperor after the completion of the monument seemed to stain the beauty of the Taj as I looked at it Visit to the Agra Fort was no better <s> How Akbar the so called emperor ' died suspected to have been poisoned by his own ambitious son Jahangir <s> How Jahangir blinded his own son Khusraw a contender for the throne as per Akbar is will <s> Shah Jahan Jahangir is son killed his own brothers to secure the throne and was finally imprisoned by his own son Aurangzeb in this very Agra Fort Listening to the guide giving the tales of treachery deceit barbarism cruelty and ruthless ambition that was played out in these monuments of Moghul historicity I wondered how this land of Vedic culture based on truth and dharma gave way to such lowly culture of killings loot plunder and lust Greed lust cruelty and barbarism reflected in every story told by the guide <s> He showed us the phansi ghar in the basement not open to public so we could just peep in just below the Jahangiri Palace which incidentally was a place for rest and pleasure for the women in the emperor is harem <s> It made me wonder why a phansi ghar was situated inside the living quarters and just below the place where the emperor indulged in pleasures <s> I was then told by the guide that this was the place where the women queens of the harem who fell out in disfavour were tortured and executed Only a Moghul emperor could drink the choicest of wines and enjoy pleasures sitting atop a dungeon where hapless and screaming women were being tortured and tormented Looking down from the Fort we were shown a tank like structure and were curious <s> The guide related the story <s> It was a favourite sport of the members of the royal family <s> Elephants were kept around the tank deprived of water in hot seasons <s> They were drugged to make them thirstier <s> In that state after days of deprivation of water they were led to this tank which was filled with alcohol <s> As they drank the alcohol in that inebriated state of extreme thirst they bloodied each other as the emperor and other royals watched with pleasure This was the culture that invaded the land where Sanatan Dharama was practiced <s> A land where animate and inanimate were revered where birds animals and even rivers mountains were worshipped That Hindu India was prosperous and full of riches has been chronicled by various travellers <s> It was a coveted land <s> One is told of how rubies emeralds sapphires and diamonds were embe 'ed in the walls of the Moghul monuments and mausoleums creating ornate designs <s> Jewels were set into the floors across the vast marble <s> The splendour and wealth of the Moghul courts has been narrated over the years <s> Where did all this wealth come from Obviously plundered and looted from the people of the land <s> Babur the first Moghul was a nomad and obviously did not bring it from his country <s> The wealth was plundered from the temples state treasuries and the peoples of this land <s> It was the wealth of the Hindu land conquered by the invaders given to plunder and loot Even before Muslims came to India there were wars and battles between the Kings <s> There were conquerors and there were the conquered <s> However the wars were mainly fought between the martial classes <s> Strange as it may sound today the Kings and princes observed time honoured conventions that were sanctioned in Shastras <s> For example places of worship were never touched <s> The Brahmins and the learned were not harmed women were not violated and cows were not killed <s> In fact non combatant civil population were never killed or captured as the battles were mostly fought in open spaces <s> The local population was never plundered and war booty was an unknown concept in wars and battles fought then <s> The kings had a code of honour and violating this code was considered reprehensible and kings found it worse than death However Muslim invaders came with a different code <s> They would fall upon unarmed hapless civil population after a victory on the battlefield <s> They would burn down villages and towns after the defending martial warriors had been killed <s> They went in for mass murders of the civil population and Brahmins were their special targets <s> They pillaged and looted even from the bodies of the dead <s> They raped and captured women who were considered a part of the booty <s> Those who were not killed were sold as slaves <s> This was the code of the Muslim invaders code of their Prophet <s> They did it all for their Prophet as holy warriors ' <s> The world famous historian Will Durant has written in his Story of Civilisation that 'the Mohammedan conquest of India was probably the bloodiest story in history ' <s> The Hindus found it very hard to understand the psychology of this new invader which they were witnessing for the first time in history <s> If one were to read the chronicles of those times advent of the Muslims into India became possible only through deceit and treachery and not out of valor or greater prowess Then came the British and the plundering of this hapless people continued and more than ever before <s> It was not a plundering for a short while <s> It lasted for a full <date> years from the battle Plassey in <date> to Independence in <date> <s> So much so that a country which even after being ruled over by the Muslim invaders for so long was considered the 'brightest jewel in the British Crown ' at the beginning of the 20th century India was the poorest country in the world in terms of per capita income After <date> years of attacks against Hinduism India gained Independence but at the cost of partition of the land with hundreds of thousands of Hindus killed and driven out of their homes by Muslim claimants to the North Western part of the country Last 60 years India has tried to regain its self with economic progress on all the fronts <s> Today it is being projected as the 'Superpower ' of tommorrow <s> It has tried to forgive and forget the wounds afflicted since the days of Mohd bin Qasim <s> It has been trying to think of a better future for its people <s> Hindus accepted a large part of Muslim population within even though a separate state Pakistan was carved out as homeland for Muslims <s> They embraced the followers of Christianity which had bled them and ruled over them for over <date> years <s> All because Hindu way of life is inherently tolerant and accepts all diversity with a vision of Vasudaiva Kutumbakam world is one family <s> However it has again become a target of these two monotheistic religions <s> For over a decade now Islamic terrorists have been attacking mainly the Hindu population <s> The objective of the jihadi ' terrorists is to divide India once again on the basis of religion and create what they envision as Mughalistan <s> On the other hand the poor and underprivileged are constantly being targeted by the Christian evangelists converting them to Christianity against lure of money brought in from the affluent West <s> These conversions have assumed alarming proportions in the last couple of years Is history waiting to repeat

<s> Former CIA Director Michael V <s> Hayden was fond of saying that when it came to handling high value terror suspects he would play in fair territory but with 'chalk dust on my cleats 'Four legal memos released last week by the Obama Administration make it clear that the referee role in CIA interrogations was played by its medical and psychological personnel According to the U <s> S <s> Department of Justice is Office of Legal Counsel which authored the memos legal approval to use waterboarding sleep deprivation and other abusive techniques pivoted on the existence of a isystem of medical and psychological monitoring 'of interrogations <s> Medical and psychological personnel were the arbiters of torture assigned to monitor interrogations and intervene to ensure that interrogators didn 't cause iserious or permanent harm 'and thus violate the U <s> S <s> Federal statute against torture The reasoning sounds almost circular <s> As one memo from May <date> put it 'The close monitoring of each detainee for any signs that he is at risk of experiencing severe physical pain reinforces the conclusion that the combined use of interrogation techniques is not intended to inflict such pain 'In other words as long as medically trained personnel were present and approved of the techniques being used it was not torture The memos provide official confirmation of both much-reported and previously unknown roles of doctors psychologists physician assistants and other medical personnel with the CIA is Office of Medical Services <s> The government is lawyers characterized these medical roles as isafeguards 'for detainees Medical oversight was present from the beginning of the special interrogation program following the <date> attacks and appears to have grown more formalized over the program is existence <s> The earliest of the four memos from August <date> states that a medical expert with experience in the military is Survival Evasion Resistance Escape <smiley> 'SERE ' training would be present during waterboarding of detainee Abu Zubaydah and would put a stop to procedures 'if deemed medically necessary to prevent severe medical or physical harm to Zubaydah ' All interrogation techniques the memos said were 'imported 'from SERE Later the CIA is Office of Medical Services OMS personnel were involved in 'designing safeguards for and in monitoring implementation of the procedures 'used on other high value detainees <s> In December <date> the OMS produced a set of 'Guidelines on Medical and Psychological Support to Detainee Rendition Interrogation and Detention 'a still-secret document that is heavily quoted from in three legal memos that were written the following year The CIA declined our request to comment further on the OMS is role in detainee treatment <s> The OMS employs physicians psychologists and other medical professionals to care for CIA employees and their families Perhaps the most chilling aspect of the memos is their intimation that medical professionals conducted a form of research on the detainees clearly without their consent 'In order to best inform future medical judgments and recommendations it is important that every application of the waterboard be thoroughly documente 'done memo reads <s> The documentation included not only how long the procedure lasted how much water was used and how it was poured but also 'if the naso- or oropharynx was filled what sort of volume was expelled and how the subject looked between each treatment 'Special instructions were also issued with regard to documenting experience with sleep deprivation and 'regular reporting on medical and psychological experiences with the use of these techniques on detainees 'was required The Nuremberg Code adopted after the horrors of amedical research 'during the Nazi Holocaust requires among other things the consent of subjects and their ability to call a halt to their participation The memos also draw heavily on the advice of psychologists that interrogation techniques would not be expected to cause lasting harm <s> At times this advice sounds contradictory <s> While calling waterboarding amedically acceptable 'the OMS also deemed it 'the most traumatic of the enhanced interrogation techniques 'The fact that traumatic events have the potential to cause long-lasting post-traumatic stress syndrome has been well documented <s> Physicians for Human Rights in interviews with eleven former detainees held in Iraq and Afghanistan found isevere long-term physical and psychological consequences 'All the individuals we evaluated were ultimately released without ever being charge 'dsaid Dr <s> Allen Keller medical director of the Bellevue New York University School of Medicine Program for Survivors of Torture The memos describe the techniques in highly precise and clinical detail befitting a medical textbook <s> During water boarding in which a physician and psychologist were to be present at all times 'the detainee is monitored to ensure that he does not develop respiratory distress <s> If the detainee is not breathing freely after the cloth is removed from his face he is immediately moved to a vertical position in order to clear the water from his mouth nose and nasopharynx 'Side effects including vomiting aspiration and throat spasm that could cut off breathing were each a 'ressed 'In the event of such spasms if necessary the intervening physician would perform a tracheotomy 'While physician assistants could be present when most 'enhanced 'techniques were applie 'duse of the waterboard requires the presence of a physician 'one memo said quoting the OMS Guidelines Doctors were also described as having vetted the practices for safety <s> Certain limits on waterboarding were created 'with extensive input from OMS 'One memo states that OMS 'doctors and psychologists 'confirmed that combining the various techniques 'would not operate in a different manner from the way they do individually so as to cause severe pain 'Medical and psychological personnel were required to observe whenever interrogators came into physical contact with detainees including slapping them and pushing them into flexible walls <smiley> 'walling ' <s> Whenever a detainee was doused with cold water a medical officer had to be on hand to monitor for signs of hypothermia <s> Confining prisoners to cramped boxes required 'continuing consultation between the interrogators and OMS officers 'Prisoners made to stand for long periods to prevent sleep were to carefully monitor detainees for swelling of the legs and other dangerous conditions and at least three times early in the program were switched on medical advice to 'horizontal sleep deprivation 'This was one example of how medical personnel could according to the CIA help prevent isevere physical or mental pain or suffering 'on the part of the detainees <s> However the memos show that the OMS is role was not merely to limit the medical impact of interrogations but also to consult on the effectiveness of interrogations <s> A May 30 <date> memo quotes the OMS suggesting that cramped confinement was 'not particularly effective 'because it provides 'a safe haven offering respite from interrogation 'Monitoring interrogations is a role that the American Medical Association among others has rejected pointing out that the presence of physicians or other medical personnel could paradoxically make interrogations more dangerous <s> As Keller explains it 'The interrogator may think well the health professional will stop me if I go too far <s> The health professional is thinking I am really here at the behest of the CIA <s> There is a tension of dual loyalty 'Just as officials in the Justice Dept now condemn waterboarding as torture so too did opinion change at another organization the American Psychological Association <s> In the frightening days following the <date> attacks 'there were two schools of thoughts in the psychological community <s> One was if you were there on the ground you could do some goo 'dsaid APA spokesperson Rhea Farberman whose organization was criticized for originally taking that position <s> The group is current stance is to forbid psychologists from participating she said 'If you are there on the ground you may be seen as condoning the behavior 'Some medical professionals are calling for colleagues to be investigated and sanctioned <s> But finding out which professionals were involved in designing monitoring and implementing the interrogation techniques may be difficult <s> The four memos were released almost in their entirety <s> The few redactions concerned mainly the names of the personnel involved

<s> Sorry for taking so long to write properly but I literally haven 't had a spare minute to do anything these last few weeks <s> Advance warning that this is likely to be a very long post so I can tell you everything thats been going on <s> I really miss it when I dont get time to blog and I find my mood starts to go down hill when I am bottling things up that I can 't get out of my system via a good old blog post silly but true Right so first news I suppose is that I am now writing for two blogs Yes the woman who can 't keep one blog up to date is now writing 2 The reason I am doing this is because I have been made a patient ambassador for the transplant charity Live Life then Give Life <s> Along with my lovely friend Rachael Wakefield we will be telling our stories helping people put a face to the transplant statistics and writing a blog about life waiting for transplant you can read the blog here or via the link in the right hand column <s> I am really honoured to have been asked

were some of the hardest I 've encountered and no one could have been more suprised than I was when I recieved an A grade for both of them <punctuationfreak> The first A grades I 've recieved on any of my OU courses <s> It really has made all the hard work worthwhile but more than that its made me feel valuable and like I 've achieved something <s> As I have said over on the ambassador blog studying is something that has nothing to do with illness but is the one thing that remains just for me <s> To do well on it makes me unbelievably satisfied and happy <s> The course has done more for me than just cheer me up it has made me seriously consider what I want to do study wise <s> I have enjoyed this literature based course more than any of the others I have done and am so far doing well on it <s> It is making me think about changing my degree subject to a BA in Literature <s> This would mean me doing a few more courses but I really think deep down this could be right for me <s> I know it sounds completely mad to change this late in the day and very unlike me but I have to compromise on so many things why should I not take a leap of faith here A Literature degree would make more sense for any acting dreams I have and if I find the work more enjoyable then I think its worth it <s> I am still yet to decide properly but its something I am very seriously considering <s> On the not so good side I have been finding myself struggling more lately <s> I have reached the point in my course where I am kept very busy and there is a lot riding on these last few months essays <s> I am also struggling more with my health <s> I had a good clinic visit at the end of January but for months now I have been getting more breathless exhausted with trivial things <s> Last month I had my oxygen levels checked to see if I required more oxygen to make my life easier <s> Everything is coming back as stable my lung function is stable oxygen is ok blood tests showed my infection markers are fine all definate positives but I still feel awful on a day to day basis <s> It sounds awful but I almost feel as though I am hovering in an area in between 'ill enough to do something and ok enough that theres nothing that will make a difference ' and to be honest I 'd rather be one or the other <s> Its been over 2 and a half years since I went on the list and while I expect things to have declined it is very very hard to feel you need help and support but not to recieve it <s> Over the last few weeks I have become very wheezy and my chest often feels very uncomfortable <s> My treatment regieme barely leaves me any time to study and I feel like what I want to do has to take a back seat <s> Its like the CF is getting bigger and I am getting smaller <s> I am determined to finish my course and to do it to the very best of my ability but when I am constantly doing meds or feeling ill it is becoming almost impossible see here <s> Things like my blog keeping in touch with friends etc are falling down my list and I am struggling to keep my head above water at the moment <s> That said I will keep going until things get easier <s> I will do as much as i can even in the small snatches of time that I get away from treatments <s> I will keep on because of how lucky I am to still be here and because I will not let CF take away something else I hold so dear to me <s> I want this transplant so badly now this life at the moment is making me appreciate how good things are going to become one day <s> There are so many things right now that I have to push to the back of my mind because I can 't do them and to think about them physically hurts me <s> I miss so many aspects of the life I haven 't even been able to begin yet <s> If I am not around much lately you will

<s> As I 've mentioned in a number of my posts my A ' spouse and I separated several years ago because I just couldn 't take dealing with his A ' issues any more <s> Even though he had been on medication and in counseling for 10 years there were still many problems especially in the area of communication <s> As our marriage disintegrated the communications got worse <s> So when we decided we wanted to try to salvage our marriage my husband is counselor who also knew me from some joint counseling sessions we had done suggested that we should try a different approach to communication <s> Instead of discussing things at any old time and getting into communications problems constantly he proposed that we have several formal meetings each week where we would talk about problems and conflicts matters that might require negotiation plans and status -- just like in a business meeting <s> The rest of the time outside the meetings we would only converse on pleasant topics -- like social chit-chat or anything else we both enjoyed unless it was something exceptionally urgent like 'the house is on fire ' <s> The intent was to create a context for my husband to be able to focus his attention on the items we needed to discuss while freeing him the rest of the time from having to try to pay attention when his mind was already engaged with something else <s> With some reservations on both sides we began scheduling meetings and trying to work within this framework <s> I found it frustrating to 'hold off 'talking about matters that arose that were important to me until our meeting -- when I see a problem I want to tackle it NOW -- and my husband initially had trouble with being prepared for the meetings but we adjusted after a couple of months <s> Business meetings are usually set for definite periods of time and we quickly learned that we needed to do the same -- at first my husband could only maintain focus for an hour at best <s> Often that meant that topics got deferred to a later meeting which was very frustrating for me <s> But as we became more practiced he was able to increase his focus time so this problem eventually went away <s> Normally people don 't yell at each other in a business meeting it is unprofessional -- at first we didn 't implement this concept in our meetings and we ended up with some meetings being just one concentrated yelling spree <s> Since my husband can 't think at all when he gets upset our discussions were going nowhere so we adopted this business policy as well <s> This was very difficult for me to implement since I am an impatient angry sort of person by nature but it was well worth it since the reduction of the emotional tension made it much more possible for my husband to apply his mind to the subjects at hand <s> Other problems arose my husband took few notes and so some of things we 'd talk about never got 'on his radar screen 'for follow-up when he took notes they were often so vague that he 'd misinterpret them later on and then we 'd be at o is about what had been discussed and worst he 'd forget the date time and not show up or show up late even though we created a regular schedule <punctuationfreak> <s> These were serious roadblocks and it took some pretty hard work to deal with them <s> To help my husband take better notes we 'd compare notes at the end of each discussion or at the end of the meeting to make sure we had both captured the same information -- he would read back his notes and I 'd identify any discrepancies with mine and then we would mutually resolve the discrepancies <s> In the process of making sure we were 'on the same page ' we 'd also be able to ensure that his notes were more detailed and less vague <s> As far as the lateness forgetting problem went we agreed to implement a rule that if he failed to renegotiate a meeting date time ahead of time and was late or a no-show that the meeting would be rescheduled at my convenience but I had to be fair and not just schedule a bad time for him as 'pay-back ' <s> There were other policies we found useful to implement through trial and error <s> Since it wasn 't certain there would be enough time to cover everything we decided to cover 'logistical 'topics first e g who has what appointments coming up this week who is picking up the dry cleaning when etc then topics where some decision was necessary project status and such and finally more nebulous topics that involve some negotiation or conflict or exploration <s> Before we instituted the meetings my husband often felt that I was always the one driving the discussions so to avoid that we developed a policy that we would a 'ress his agenda before mine not necessarily his entire agenda -- but his logistics before mine his project status before mine etc When my husband would agree to take on some task in our meetings he 'd make notes about it but wouldn 't necessarily set a particular target date -- and without a target date he would have no reminder alarm in his PDA or anywhere else so it often wouldn 't get done -- so now we set up a target date in the meeting as well <s> When I would ask for status on some item that he was supposed to be working on he 'd sometimes have a hard time remembering what he was supposed to have been doing and it slowed down our meetings a lot to go over it -- so now he does a brief review of his notes of the previous meeting before we start each new one <s> We fi 'led with the frequency of our meetings at times but generally have found that three times a week works best for us <s> We both sometimes relapse into bad old habits but we now have the mechanisms in place to correct those problems when they occur <s> Once we ironed out these wrinkles after about six months we found that the meetings not only accomplished their intended purposes of providing a structured context for discussion and negotiation plus better interactions outside the meetings but they some pleasant unexpected results as well <s> My husband has become much better at follow-through because he knows there will be a status check in an upcoming meeting and this has reduced my need to nag <s> I 've learned how to a 'ress conflicts without yelling well most of the time <s> We have a much more structured dynamic for communications which leads to fewer misunderstandings <s> My husband is note-taking has improved so greatly that we rarely need to do re-caps anymore which shortens the meetings and again contributes to better follow-through <s> And the meetings as we have set them up provide a method for coming back to unresolved problems with the chance to review the notes and reflect during the intervening time -- this has been an important element in reaching an accord on many of the more fundamental complex problems surrounding A ' behaviors <s> I 've resisted the urge to end with a bullet-list summary of 'rules 'for setting up such meetings this kind of setup should not be a straight-jacket and I think that each couple has different problems and therefore needs for different rules which only they can discover as they work through this kind of process themselves <s> I think the only real rule is the original intent -- to create a context for focused attention on interpersonal matters and to exclude those discussions from the rest of your interactions <s> This isn 't a perfect system -- it doesn 't always work smoothly every time -- but it is a very helpful framework <s> Suffice it to say that these meetings were a key component in ending our separation -- I really don 't know if we could have resolved our communications problems without them -- and we have found them so helpful we are still holding them more than four years later They can definitely be a powerful tool in the A '-coping toolbox

<s> We were at the Union Station by 6 30 an hour before the designated schedule <s> We walked over the counter to show my online reservation <s> I asked the guy manning the counter if I would have any difficulty with my luggage or if I need to check it in <s> He took one look at me and my bags there was a trolley bag a backpack and a shoulder bag and shrugged 'you 'll do just fine ' He also explained that there was one leg in my itinerary wherein checking in my luggage wasn 't an option so it would be best if I would just carry them with me <s> Anyway there would be baggage compartments where I could deposit my things

<s> Should have the gallery up in a few days <s> Not sure how I 'll photograph Vienna since the last time I was there every boring angle of statues buildings and museums was duly captured on film <s> Yes the property was lavish attention was paid to every single detail and the staff was extraordinarily warm so trying to pick apart the hotel and keep digging for negatives when there were clearly no significant misses would be an injustice on my part personal preferences aside

<s> Great track workout <math> mile slow jog a bunch of drills high knees lunges killer long jump things etc Then we did a mile on the track sprinting on the straight parts amp walking on the curves <s> Invigorating Then a <math> mile cool down jog <s> Then one of the other girls and I did a mile jog--really nice way to wrap up an early morning workout Kind of stinks that w the time change the whole 5 <date> 45 workout was in the dark It still AMAZES me that at the end of the workout I can do a mile slow jog and talk the whole way through <s> I mean my heart rate is still going up and my lungs get a workout but it is pretty easy <s> That is just crazy <s> And awesome <s> Total was 3 miles plus the drills <s> We were out there about an hour <date> miles 36 minutes 11 00 pace <s> Okay it wasn 't a good pace but boy was it a GREAT run <s> I focused on going slow and was able to think more about lengthening my stride <s> I a 'ed a little speed at the end but if I hadn 't done that I felt like I could have run for at least 10 more minutes <s> Maybe my easiest run ever <s> But still a good workout <s> I am liking this slow jogging thing <smiley> Wow Not the greatest energy today but a great run This is the furthest I 've ever run but just a bit both time distance I am pleased that I focused on conserving my energy but was still a little faster than Thursday even though speed isn 't the goal right now Next week when I a ' 4 more minutes to my run I should be up over 3 5 miles <smiley> <date> miles 36 minutes 10 <math> mile <date> miles in 33 minutes <math> 52 per mile For my 10K training I am focusing on SLOWING my pace so that I can run a bit longer each week and build up my endurance This felt like a great fairly easy pace for me <s> I was able to speed up just a bit in the last half mile and I sprinted for the last 45 seconds <s> Knowing I had that extra energy at the end I know I could have gone further 6 2 miles seems a lot more attainable when I am not pushing my speed The trainer doing our Tuesday track sessions gave me advice on how to train for my April 4 10K <s> Here is the plan Week 1 this week Track training 33 minute run <date> minute runs Week 2 Track training 36 minute run <date> minute runs Week 3 Track training 40 minute run <date> minute runs Week 4 Track training 44 minute run <date> to 49 minute runs So the idea is to increase my distance by <math> per week and to run the whole way no matter how slow I need to go <s> That way I 've got the endurance to run most and maybe even all of the 10K <s> Running the whole way would be amazing but I am not putting too much pressure on myself <s> That would be about 20 minutes longer than my longest training run <s> We 'll see how much energy motivation and adrenaline I have on race day Right now I think a reasonable goal for the 10K is 68 12 or less <s> That is an average of 11 minutes or less per mile <s> As I get closer I 'll reevaluate to determine if that still seems like a good goal or not <s> I am starting weekly group track workouts with a trainer to help my running <s> Today we did a slow warm-up jog <math> mile then did a timed mile <s> One mile time was 8 58 Personal best I am thrilled to have run a mile in under 9 minutes This was my first official 5K My pace was just a smidge slower than last time I ran in my neighborhood <s> I think with the excitement I got off on my breathing and I did a little bit of walking near the end because of some side cramps and just being winded <s> But it went great and I can 't wait to beat this time next time I do a race Out of <date> women I was 91 which puts me precisely in the mi 'le of the pack <s> I am pretty happy with that with under 4 <math> months of running under my belt Honestly I was hoping to have my personal best time pace but it was still a really great experience <s> More interval training Used one of Skip Orem is <weirdcaps> podcasts again <s> Man it is HARD My isprints 'are not very fast at the end But I know it 'll help my speed in the long run and I enjoy the challenge <s> I heartily recommend these podcasts <s> Woo hoo--cut 48 seconds of my previous best 5K time <punctuationfreak> Wow that is getting very close to my 10 minute per mile goal Tomorrow I 'll do some interval training then Sunday is my first official 5K <s> Hoping the adrenaline gets me down to my goal <date> miles in 31 33 10 <math> mile 
<s> We did some more ringing in the garden this morning <s> When Derek arrived it was raining steadily and we didn 't think we 'd be able to get any nets up at all <s> After a cup of coffee things brightened up and we put up one 40 ' net <s> We stood in the kitchen and watched birds flying over under and round the side of the net <s> It was pretty dispiriting Eventually we caught two Blue Tits and a Great Tit simultaneously and then it got windy <s> So things weren 't looking too good <s> Fortunately despite the wind and occasional drizzle we did OK <s> We caught two Reed Buntings we 've had as many as 15 in the garden at the same time this week which was pretty good <s> This one is a male <s> The pale flecks on his head will soon wear away revealing smart plain black feathers underneath <s> For a while it looked likely that the Reed Buntings would be the highlight of the morning <s> Then we caught this bird A Great Tit you say <s> Not very interesting surely <s> Well the thing about this Great Tit is that it already had a ring and it wasn 't one that we 'd put on <s> So it is come from somewhere else <s> In itself that is interesting enough we 'll have to wait to find out where it was ringed <s> The extra-interesting thing was that the ring was a size larger than normal - a B ring AAs are the smallest for things like Goldcrests and Willow Warblers then As and Bs are usually for birds like Greenfinches <s> When young Great Tits are ringed in the nest as chicks or pulli as ringers like to refer to them they need the next ring size up <s> This is because their legs are actually fatter while they 're developing The ring still fits OK now that the bird is a thinner-legged adult but hopefully the person who ringed it will be really pleased to hear that one of their pulli has made it to adulthood <s> The reason that Great Tits have such huge families up to 9 eggs is because many of them - <math> on average - will die in their first year

<s> Almost a year ago today I was told I had less than a year to live <s> After two months of deteriorating health unsure diagnosis wrong diagnosis is different medications and a mind full of questionable thoughts I was told what I feared the most <s> I didn 't cry that day or the next <s> I accepted my fate and I remember just trying to show everyone in my life that it was okay <s> I came to really realize what the meaning everything in life happens for a reason ' truly meant <s> I figured that there was nothing but hard times to come and honestly I was okay with that <s> This past year has been difficult in many different aspects <s> I 've watched my family and loved ones cry with tears of sorrow and tears of joy <s> I 've had breathing tubes put in and taken out <s> I 've struggled with learning to walk again and being able to hear my own voice after four weeks of being unable to speak <s> I know that the ups and downs I faced last summer are never going to even compare to the things I am going to encounter in the future because nothing was that difficult <s> If I were to experience this again I would accept it as I did the first time around <s> Despite the hardships that came with what happened I was surrounded by loved ones every single day <s> And if things were to happen differently if things were to be worse then that would be fine because I can 't change what is already going to happen <s> The only things I can change are my attitude about it and make the most out of what was to come <s> To be honest I never thought I would have had such a great turnaround <s> I remember thinking in the hospital that there wasn 't anything I could do but when things started to look better when I was still able to lift my left hand up when I was starting to regain a little strength I knew I couldn 't waste it <s> I knew that I had to keep trying keep fighting and keep doing my best to get past whatever it was that was holding me back <s> Even to this day despite multiple doctors ' visits MRIs cardio appointments etc the doctors are still unsure of what exactly happened to me <s> They think it is an isolated case a onetime occurrence but they said they couldn 't say that for certain <s> All I know is that without the love and support of the people around me the people I don 't know the amazing hospital staff at Children is <math> is the age limit there Aha I wouldn 't be where I am today <s> You all made me keep fighting you all gave me the strength I needed to push myself your support kept me from giving up in the moments where that is all I wanted to do <s> So thank you for your thoughts for your prayers and for just showing me love in the time where I needed it the most <s> And I hope that you all know I appreciate everything you 've all done and I care about each and every one of you even if I don 't know you or we don 't speak anymore <s> I wish you all the best and I will keep doing my best to make a difference in this world and to show you all that your thoughts weren 't wasted <s> Hi everyone I haven 't updated this blog much lately on account of there isn 't any news for me to share with you all in regards to my health plus I update my personal blog <s> Other than the good news of my life has returned to normal and whatever in my brain has been shrinking there isn 't much for me to a ' <s> I have a math final tommorow and this quarter is pretty much over and done with <s> Also been working around 4 days a week <s> Been saving up money for my big trip <s> I thought you might all want to see the MRI is I had done these are just two <s> My first one ever taken and the circled red area is actually the inflammation what I shall refer to it as its ' really big that is why the doctors were so insistant that it was a tumor <s> This was taken in June of <date> <s> This second picture is a different angle and the circled area is the spot what is left of the inflammation <s> It is pretty much smaller than a pea which is great news <s> This picture was taken October <date> <s> A very big change in <math> months <s> I just wanted to say thank yuo all again for everything and for keeping me in your prayers <s> Also I cut off about <math> inches of my hair yesterday so here is what I look like as of right now Maybe I should upload a video of me doing a strenous exercise or something to show you guys my progress First of all I feel exteremy lucky and blessed to able to share good no great news with you all <s> It is almost as if I 've been given another chance to make the most out of my life <s> God has blessed me with great people and a challenge that I am overcoming <s> Today I went to Childrens to get the results of my MRI from last week <s> The neurologist told me that they still don 't have a clear idea of what it is or what made it occur <s> The tests they sent out over the summer with my blood etc all came back negative normal <s> So that is a pretty good sign <s> Then she showed me pictures of my brain <s> She showed me the original MRI picture from back in August which showed a very large white spot in my medula and then she showed me the picture from last week is MRI and the white spot seems to almost be gone now <s> Which means that my brain is getting back to normal the color and it is only got a very little spot of gray white left <s> So everything is getting better and they want to keep me on surveilance for awhile <s> My next MRI is going to be in January before my trip and then after that I only need to get an MRI every 6 months so things are going good Also on another note I recently came into news in regards to some people that I do not know <s> And it is really sad because sometimes its so hard to believe that some people are so unhappy to the point where they need to end their own lives <s> I know people suffer and people hurt but I just wish people didn 't hurt to that point that extent <s> Life is so precious and we 're all only given one <s> Maybe someone had a bad day maybe someone had a lot of bad days maybe it was just a fluke <s> I don 't know what I do know is that we all have the power to make other people feel better about their situations whether it be by offering a smile giving wave being courteous or even holding a door <s> We all have the power to do something and to brighten someones day so we should <s> Why let people suffer quietly Why let people harbor pain Why let people think that no one cares when we do This whole sitaution has changed my outlook on life and the values of family and friends <s> There is never a moment now where I don 't want to do something for other people and it is not because oh 'I should ' it is because I want to <s> And I hope you all want to bring happiness to others even if you don 't know them <s> Sometimes all they need is one person to show them that things can be okay and that strangers care <s> You 've all shown me you care and for that I am eternaly thankful without it I don 't know where I would be <s> For the past two or so weeks I 've been having headaches they 're not bad headaches nor do they hurt <s> They 're just annoying and on the same side of my head every time <s> So my follow up MRI and Neurology appointment isn 't until November 17 and 18 however I saw my doctor on Tuesday and she made a call and I had an MRI this morning at 7 15 <s> Which was very early especially for me <s> I had to leave at 6 am But the MRI went well and I am just waiting to hear from Neurology in regards to how the scan my brain looks <s> I hope that things continue to improve for me and apart of me knows things will things always get better <s> But if they don 't then that is okay too becasue everything happens for a reason <s> I am not scared or worried in regards to any of this business going on I am just trying to make the most out of everything in my life at this point <s> School is not bad but doing a full load online sure is not that fun I started working again too 4 days a week it is not bad either <s> I need something to keep me busy <s> My friends have been great hanging out treating me like I am normal again <s> Which I 'd like to think I am other than the fact that I have to take heart medication <s> I feel like things are normal for me again and I feel my old life habits resurfacing <s> Althoguh some are difficult to ignore others aren 't <s> I still am striving towrads a better life etc <s> And today I realzied what one of my possible careers is will be <s> I have a few but this one I really want to see out <s> I 'll update once I get the results of my MRI <s> Thank you for checking this blog and for praying for me <s> I cannot stress enough how much I appreciate everything you have all done for me <s> The world needs more people like this <s> Also dont ' forget to vote Hey all Some news for you finally an update I had a cardiology appointment a week or two ago and they said that basically I am giong to have to stasy on my heart medication <s> I had a few episodes when I was in the hospital where my heart would beat up to <date> bpm <s> So anyway my heart still does a fast beat sometimes out of nowhere but not anywhere near as bad almost like i went for a run and its beating trying to slow down <s> I had a followup appointment wtih the whole rehab team today and basically i am doing really good my strength is come back etc <s> They even told me that they hadn 't ever seen such a big turnaround ever <s> So my appointment went well and i am basically cleared for driving traveling <s> Even though I started driving again a few weeks ago aha I have a followup with Neurology in November and another MRI in November and hopefully it shows another improvement On another note tommorow is my last day of Physical Therapy <smiley> Thank you all for the continued prayers <s> Sorry for the delay it is hard to come up with things to say especially when your days consist of physical therapy exercises and hanging out <s> I thought it would be boring and repetitive to tell you all the same thing over and over again <s> Anyways I 've got a slew of doctors appointments coming up in the next few weeks probably something I mentioned before <s> Things are going well for me I am still trying to do my best <s> I find myself growing snappier at my family over little things and I am trying to stop that because it is uneccesary <s> And besides a happy wennie is a better wennie <smiley> On to some intresting news I finally got my new tattoo yesterday I was stuck between two choices <s> The first was the word 'rescued ' because I feel like everything that happened to me in a way saved my life <s> I mean it sounds stupid but apart of me really feels as if this was supposed to happen <s> Almost like the life I was living before just wasn 't good enough and this thing that happeend to me forced me to accept things that I didn 't want to or could accept before forced me to push harder forced me to just be better to live better <s> That is why I feel like this thing that happened inside of my brain rescued me it rescued me from my own life <s> I don 't care if people think it is stupid or dumb because it is got meaning to me and that is all that matters <s> It is a reminder of what happened and what I need and should strive towards <s> It is also on my right arm because 1 I 've already got a tattoo on my left side and 2 its right under where they give me my IV is for my MRI is just another reminder that I 've still gotta keep pushing and giong <s> I 'll try to come up with more intresting things to tell you guys therapy is going well and the strength is returning and almost equal at least in my legs <s> I think it is almost the same in my arms too I feel like my health is improving and I am putting on weight Below is a picture of my new ink <s> Thank you for your continued prayers and good thoughts I will do my best to update more frequently Hi everyone I 've been home for almost two weeks now and things are going very well <s> The tingling and numbness I felt before I entered the hospital have gone and I feel my body becoming normal again back to what it used to <s> I still do physical therapy and I am diong it three times a week and after next week it 'll be reduced down to two times a week <s> I am able to sprint now and squat down which dosen 't seem like much but for me it is a big improvement <s> I remember the first time I tried to squat down I fell also the pain in my legs is gone when I walk so it is easier for me now to be walking a lot <s> I have another followup in two months for my MRI and a cardiology appointment in the next few weeks to see if I need to stay on my heart medicine and a follow up with the rehab doctors all my therapists too at the end of september to make sure i am on track <s> I plan on doing a full course load at school this quarter joining a gym working on my business and getting a job as a mentor at a non-profit clinic <s> Things are looking up and I am pretty happy <s> Below is a picture I put together from my time in the hospital to show yuo all the differences <s> Thank you all again for everything yuo 've done for me and for praying for me and keeping me in yuor thoughts <s> I am home I 've been home since yesterday and it is so nice to be back again <s> Things have been going pretty well here I start physical therapy at Olympic on Tuesday for 3 days a week my previous <smiley> therapist only thinks I need it for a month so hopefuly its only that long No traveling at least until January but that is okay I decided not to drop out of school and continue to do a full load this fall all online though The doctors still are unsure of my diagnosis <s> I had an MRI yesterday and it showed another slight improvement <s> My next one is scheduled for two months from now which is when my follow up appointment is <s> Hopefully things continue to progress at this rate <smiley> Thank you all again for

<s> Longtime FSP readers know that I am interested in how academia is depicted in literature and other artistic venues and that I have a particular interest in academic satire in novels <s> Although I generally disapprove of attempts to make academia and academics seem like bizarre megalomaniacal control freaks who are entirely disconnected from the 'real 'world I am not incapable of enjoying a good academic satire hence my fondness of the novel Straight Man by Richard Russo <s> I even like the Indigo Girls ' song 'Closer to Fine ' despite this horrific set of anti-academic lyrics I went to see the doctor of philosophy With a poster of Rasputin and a beard down to his knee <s> He never did marry or see a B-grade movie He graded my performance He said he could see through me <s> I spent four years prostrate to the higher mind got my paper And I was free <s> Give me a break <s> Anyway I was curious to read the recent novel '36 Arguments for the Existence of God ' Rebecca Goldstein described in some reviews as a brilliant new example in the academic satire genre <s> Washington Post Ron Charles The field of academic satire is crowded with such classics as 'Lucky Jim 'and 'Straight Man 'but '36 Arguments isports so many spot-on episodes of cerebral pomposity that you 've got to place this novel among the very funniest ever written <s> New York Times Janet Maslin <smiley> When Cass witnesses a <weirdcaps> presentation featuring 'brain scans of sophomores neuroimaged in the throes of moral deliberation over whether they should in theory toss a hapless fat man onto the tracks in order to use his bulk to save five other men from an oncoming trolley ' this book occupies its ideal vantage point close to the absurdity of current academic thinking yet just far enough away to laugh <s> Cerebral pomposity The absurdity of current academic thinking Did these reviewers also spend their college years prostrate to bearded Rasputin-loving higher minds Certainly there are pompous intellectuals in academia and some research topics and methods seem quite absurd but these are not the kinds of things I enjoy seeing parodied in novels and pilloried in reviews <s> For me the most clever and entertaining academic novels are the ones that show the absurdity of the weird-but- mundane rituals of academic life professor-student interactions faculty meetings budgets tenure and that are a bit more subtle in their portrayal of classic personalities in academe <s> Therefore I am not particularly impressed by bizarre and disturbing characters such as the 'Extreme Distinguished Professor 'in 36 Arguments and am much more entertained by a depiction of strangely recognizable people embroiled in the bizarre and disturbing rituals of a faculty search as in Straight Man <s> Said FSP is daughter is mi 'le school Science teacher to FSP when he saw her in the corridor of the school Hey it is the famous woman scientist <s> I was taken aback at first wondering why he used adjectives one of which was strange and the other implied that scientist man unless you specify otherwise hence the somewhat cynical name for this blog <s> But then I figured out why he greeted me that way <s> Later this same science teacher asked me if I would come talk to his class in a month or two <s> Great I replied <s> But I thought you were done with the unit on My Science <s> Oh ah yes <s> Actually we are doing a unit on Diversity and so we need a a a <s> Woman scientist Yes exactly <s> The state expects us to do something on Diversity and I uh uh have no clue what to do and don 't even know enough to ask this favor in a non-offensive way I didn 't say that but actually I don 't have a clue either <s> I have never talked about Diversity to a group of mi 'le school kids before <s> I assume that I should talk about all types of diversity not gender <s> I would like to keep my overall message positive and talk about Science as a rewarding career but perhaps we could also discuss stereotypes of scientists strange white males <s> I am going to have to give this a lot more thought <s> Has anyone else given a talk on Diversity to mi 'le schoolers I could use some advice <s> As both a student and a professor I have experienced at various times both the <smiley> quarter and semester systems <s> For those unfamiliar with these systems An academic year composed of quarters involves 3 academic terms a summer term 4 quarters each of 10 weeks duration fall winter spring <s> An academic year composed of semesters involves 2 terms each 15 weeks duration fall and ispring ' the former of which may include the end of summer and the latter of which includes the winter season <s> Some of my colleagues and students experience the 'block plan ' 1 intensive course per 3 week period but I have not so I will confine my comments to quarters v semesters <s> Both quarter and semester systems have advantages and disadvantages for professors and students but these pros and cons may shift around from course to course depending on various factors related to course content and professorial teaching ability <s> Quarter system Terms are shorter <s> Boring classes are over sooner and boring professors can inflict less damage <s> The content and format of some courses even very enthralling ones are better suited to a shorter term <s> Quarters typically start later September in the <smiley> and end later June than the semester-based academic year <s> You may like or dislike quarters owing to this feature alternatively you may like this feature in late August and early September when your semester colleagues have started their academic year and hate it in May and early June when your semester colleagues already have their grades done <s> It may be easier for professor to get a research leave for a quarter than it is to get a semester leave <s> Students on the quarter system may be at a disadvantage in the summer because their academic year ends late relative to the start of some summer internships and other jobs <s> Semester system Semesters can seem very very long <s> Your joy at making it to Spring Break may be a bit dampened by the realization that the semester is only half over <s> You can however explore more topics in more depth than you can with a shorter term <s> You may have more flexibility in course content owing to the longer term <s> You get to know your students better <s> You might even learn all their names <s> You may start the academic year before you are ready for summer to end but you are done in the spring <s> Depending on your institutions policies re teaching load you may have fewer course preps year <s> You only have to deal with beginning and end of semester craziness twice instead of 3 times <s> In an academic term the first couple of weeks and the last week or two can be quite chaotic but in a semester there is plenty of time in the mi 'le to get into a routine in which the logistics of the course are at least functioning well <s> As a student I didn 't have a strong preference even once I had experienced both systems <s> Depending on how many courses I was expected to take at once and what the course offerings were I may have had a slight preference for one over the other but overall it didn 't matter a lot to me <s> As a professor I think I prefer the quarter system recognizing that semesters do have some distinct advantages <s> For most courses I feel that I can convey the most essential information in 10 weeks <s> I wouldn 't like quarters if I had to create new courses all the time but for a relatively stable set of courses and only the occasional new course to prepare quarters are better for maintaining a high energy level and morale from term start to term end <s> Which do you like Semesters or quarters or something else Some applications for open faculty positions require letters of recommendation up-front some request letters only after there has been a first stage of selection based on other information supplied by the applicant <s> Although I don 't mind the first method I prefer the second because it seems like a better use of time for those writing the letters and for those reading the applications <s> I know that things are done in a different way at many non- <smiley> institutions but lately I have encountered variations on this system within the <smiley> <s> In the past few months - I received a request for a letter of reference for someone who had already been invited to interview at a <smiley> institution <s> In fact no letters of reference were solicited until this stage so my letter wasn 't supplementary or an attempt to fill a reference letter quota <s> The letters were clearly not a part of the interview selection decision <s> It is unclear what role if any they have in the search and - I received a request for a letter of reference after someone had a phone interview but before they were invited for the actual interview <s> I am glad I am not on that hiring committee as it seems to involve several extra steps <s> I didn 't mind either of those requests although the first case made me wonder why the institution even bothered to get letters if they are so unimportant in the process <s> Perhaps it is an administrative requirement Having read thousands of these letters I must say I can 't really blame anyone for not valuing reference letters very much <s> A letter request that did annoy me however was one accompanied by the information that my letter would not even be read unless the candidate advanced to the final interview stage <s> In this case the position is not an academic one so perhaps I just lack familiarity with how things are done outside academia <s> From what I could tell from the instructions the organization will not read the letters before the final candidates are selected from a huge pool of applicants but wants to have the letters on hand to read as soon as the final interviewees are selected and hence the request for possibly superfluous letters <s> I can understand the wish for efficiency especially given the large number of applicants but it is a bit of a strange request Please write this letter even though we are unlikely to read it <s> We need to be efficient but we are willing to possibly waste your time <s> Wouldn 't such a request lend itself to getting cursory letters or letters that are not focused specifically on the position for which the applicant has applied I typically take some time to customize each letter depending on what the position is and in some cases this takes quite a bit of time <s> Why would I do that if I don 't know if my letter will even be read I guess I will do it for the same reason we write any reference letters not knowing if the subject of the letters will get the position <s> Despite knowing in this particular case that my letter may be transferred unread directly to an electronic trash heap I think the best strategy is to try to forget about that and write the letter in the hopes that it will eventually be read the student will get the job and it will all be worthwhile in the end <s> A reader asks How long do you typically give 1st or 2nd year grad students to 'pull things together 'when they struggle in the beginning Where is the line is drawn and what factors affect the judgments professors will make about their students I will consider only <weirdcaps> students in this discussion <s> I should say right away that I do not have a foolproof way of deciding when or where to draw the line on struggling students <s> I tend to err on the side of delusional optimism hoping that some solution involving change in project topics methods degree of supervision more structure specific goal-setting or approach to writing will pull us all through the problems <s> Only in hindsight has it been obvious when this was a bad plan resulting in prolonged suffering and expense <s> In other cases it has worked by 'worked 'I mean that the student got their <weirdcaps> and therefore any difficulties were worth it I think <s> That said when and where I draw the line depends on the specific things with which the student is struggling and how or whether they are making an effort to communicate about and or deal with the problem <smiley> <s> Is the problem motivation If a student is unproductive owing to a severe lack of interest or motivation in any reasonable research project they can do with me as adviser that is something that should be quite clear in the second year if not the first though I have had students who started out very energetic in the first year but whose motivation was completely extinguished in the second by the reality of what research and or working with me involves Is the problem that the student lacks the information or skills necessary to do the research That can be fixed in many cases and should be dealt with by the end of the second year <s> The student should be as proactive as possible about learning what they need to know to do their research <s> Is the problem the adviser Is this something that could be fixed by discussing the situation or is it something that can 't be changed If the latter the student has a decision to make about whether to continue with that adviser <s> Although it is possible that with time the student may understand better what seems like irrational or unkind behavior it is likely that the adviser won 't become more sane or nice with time <s> Is the problem beyond the student is control Examples Access to facilities A complex and difficult research project that may proceed in a non-linear way Lack of clear direction Research that takes a long time to produce interpretable results I am impressed by students who find ways to deal with obstacles like these <s> In fact a student who feels like they are struggling perhaps because they are too critical when comparing themselves with others may not be struggling in the eyes of the adviser and other faculty <s> Other problems such as those involving finishing a project or writing may not manifest themselves until later after the first two years <s> In the first two years it is not too late to change course in a possibly dramatic way including deciding that there is no point in continuing in the graduate program <s> There have been a few cases in which I decided in the first or second year that there was no point in advising a student for a <weirdcaps> these students got an MS instead <s> There has to be an obvious major reason for going this route though -- e g failed classes or lack of productivity owing to extreme lack of effort <s> Will a student who has a slow but not catastrophic first year or two be at a permanent disadvantage I suppose this depends on the adviser but in my opinion a student who struggles with something in the first year or two but who eventually surmounts the obstacles and succeeds should not be at a disadvantage later <s> In fact few arrive in graduate school perfectly prepared to leap into the perfect project that goes perfectly from Day One <s> If you had asked any of my graduate advisers or committee members what they thought of me in my first or second years of graduate school the responses would have ranged from a derisive snort to a polite but sympathetic chuckle at my likely future career as a cat sitter <s> That changed a few years later once I started getting results and writing papers and my slow start didn 't harm my career <s> If you mostly like what you are doing and at times possibly even love what you are doing and you want to keep going with your research despite initial problems my advice summarized is Stay focused know what your goals are short-range intermediate-range long-range communicate with your adviser and others if you feel stuck at least make some progress step-by-step even if the steps seem small and don 't worry so much <s> The Chronicle Review the magazine-like part of The Chronicle of Higher Education recently asked a group of ischolars and experts 'to comment on stress in the lives of academics using the Amy Bishop incident as a springboard for the discussion i e what role might stress related to the tenure process have played in this tragedy The scholars and experts included a writer and <weirdcaps> candidate in English literature the chancellor of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education a professor of international politics a professor of English an assistant professor of public policy and political science an assistant professor of sociology and women is and gender studies a <weirdcaps> candidate in anthropology a dean of a School of Arts amp Sciences a professor of management a professor of history Clearly there was an effort to consult a wide variety of academics associated with the <smiley> system of higher education professors and administrators tenured professors and tenure-track professors professors at universities and professors at small liberal arts colleges even some <weirdcaps> candidates who have no direct experience yet with the stresses of being on the tenure-track <s> Many of these people had thoughtful insights I was interested to know the opinions of sociologists and anthropologists and others <s> Even so Amy Bishop was an assistant professor of biology <s> Does it seem o ' to anyone else that there were no biology or other science professors in this particular group of academics commenting on the incident I looked up the chancellor and the dean and learned that their field of expertise is psychology so perhaps they come the closest but that is not the same as getting the opinion of someone who has recently experienced the tenure process as a scientist <s> I realize that a biology professor would not necessarily have any more insight into the general implications of the incident than those who provided comments in this piece in the Chronicle <s> And I still stand by my overall view shared by the <weirdcaps> candidate in English literature that the murders were the actions of an imbalanced person with a rage problem and a gun and the tragedy was therefore not a direct result of the stresses of academia in general or the tenure evaluation system in particular <s> Still I think it is strange that in an otherwise diverse group not one is a science professor with direct knowledge of what it is like to get tenure as a scientist today at a university <s> Consider how bizarre it would have been if an English professor for example had committed a heinous crime that may or may not have been related to the experience of being an English professor and the only people asked to comment in a particular series of essays were science engineering and math professors <s> I also think it would have been illuminating to read for comparison the thoughts of a scientist recently denied tenure <s> With all due respect to the <weirdcaps> candidates and literary scholars who wrote thoughtful essays for the piece surely the Chronicle could have found some current or former science professors -- ideally in the life sciences -- to comment I don 't want to perpetuate an 'us ' scientists vs 'them non-scientists mentality but often when I read about academia in the Chronicle and elsewhere the point of view of non-scientists is the only one represented <s> This gives a very incomplete view of academia and the lives of academics in general and in extreme cases <s> Although we have much in common as researchers and educators there are also significant differences that at times merit consideration <s> Who is staying away from campus for Spring Break by choice i e not owing to a furlough Who is doing this because otherwise they will have a dire childcare challenge Who is staying away from campus for a week as a sanity break so that they can face the rest of the academic year with renewed energy Of those avoiding campus Will you be going somewhere preferably fun and interesting or just staying home and possibly working there Who will be on campus but would rather not be there Who will be on campus because if they don 't they fear the consequences from their adviser from their advisees from a promotion amp tenure committee from collaborators If you are a graduate student has your adviser specifically discussed with you whether you

much more famous and smarter than I am <s> We sit in my office and we I try to find something of mutual interest that we can discuss <s> I am not a skilled conversationalist but I can almost always find something to talk about for half an hour <s> One of the things I am not tempted to discuss is the disparity in success or fame or IQ or amount of funding of whatever between the visitor and me <s> What would be the point of that It is therefore disconcerting for me when I find myself in the visitor is chair in someone else is office and they start the conversation with a series of self-deprecating statements about how they have not published as much as I have and how I write better proposals than they do and how they are basically not as successful as I am <s> This does not happen often but it happens from time to time <s> I hasten to note that this is not because I am so awesomely famous or well funded <s> My usual description of myself is 'reasonably successful 'as a scientist and I think that is accurate <s> I do not think the self-deprecation is a form of false modesty <s> The self-deprecating person is genuinely ripped up about their lack of productivity <s> I think these conversations stem more from insecurities than from anything specific about me or my career <s> Even so what I am supposed to say when confronted with these types of statements I am more than willing to have a conversation about proposal strategies or ideas for new directions in research or even to have a group wallow about some aspect of Science or Academia that is particularly controversial or nerve-wracking <s> If the self-deprecating person is a stressed out early career professor I can go into mentor mode if that seems to be a useful way to go <s> Otherwise I try to

not have encountered otherwise <date> A short while ago I received a couple of comments from a friendly blogger called 'Revivor ' and when I popped over to his blog I saw that he was organising a four day run from Clapham to Brighton to raise money for the charity CASPA Children on the Autistic Spectrum Parents ' Association <date> Naturally I was intrigued and so I contacted him straight away and we decided to meet up and chat about his noble adventure <s> Ivor Reveley check out the 'Gotta Run ' t-shirt On whether he has done such a thing before Two years ago on his fiftieth birthday Ivor and a team of runners ran from Romford to Orpington <date> They ran 50kms over 50 hours to raise money for 50 young people with autism <date> Ivor broke that down for me and explained that it is not as impossible as it sounds bearing in mind that I walk a 5km fun run once a year you run for two to three hours a day over three days and cover about 20 kilometres a day <date> It is not easy but it is possible They raised 8 <date> on that occasion which meant that their charity CASPA was able to obtain viability and get the real start that it required <date> This is so important as Ivor explains because it meant that the charity could remain a stable entity in the lives of the children and families it serves <s> On why he was raising money for CASPA Ivor is sixteen-year-old son has autism <date> After being a charity trustee for fifteen to twenty years Ivor realised that he had the skill necessary to make a difference in the lives of other children with autism and he decided to get involved with CASPA <s> On what CASPA is and what they do <s> Ivor is the chair and trustee of the charity <date> They started off as an informal parents ' association in <date> and formally registered the charity in <date> <date> As a charity they run events and workshops for young people with autism such as Brighton Beach kid is days out Youth Club on a Friday night A residential week long summer camp Independent Living Workshops which are sponsored by the LDA They have received brilliant feedback from the children who say it is a safe environment for them to have fun free from bullying or other such concerns <s> On making the runs interesting After completing A-levels in Economics Geography and Maths Ivor went on to study Economics at university <s> An avid map lover Ivor is now using his Geography and Maths skills again as he plans the most historical and geographically interesting routes through cathedrals and up high streets <date> The idea is for the runners to enjoy these events and to see and learn about the places they run through <s> On this year is event Date 30 April 3 May <date> <s> Route Clapham Common to Brighton Beach route details Ivor hopes to do events like this every even year and this year they will be doing a four day run from Clapham to Brighton <date> Ivor is keeping a log of all of the training and organising of the event in his blog Four Days Running <s> A half marathon is 21km and these runners will be doing more than that each day as they will run from about <date> pm to 5pm every day for four days <s> Friends family and supporters will be able to meet up with the runners every evening as pub nights are being organised on Facebook and the hotels that the group is staying in is published on the site stay on route <s> This is not a public run but anyone interested in joining the run can contact Ivor at the site to get involved <date> They have a photographer taking part this year so expect great photos On how YOU can help You can donate money using the button above <date> That will take you to the Just Giving site where the money will go straight to the charity and won 't touch anyone is hands <s> But don 't worry there are lots of other ways to help too Follow the Four Days Running blog Follow Ivor is Twitter account revivor <date> Join the fun and do the four day run Run With <smiley> Stay on the route

advice on fine read really rather expensive dining in Britain <s> Barely a day goes by when we don 't hear of someone is tales of woe with regards to their finances <s> Maybe nary a day goes by when you don 't think of your OWN tales of personal finance horror but this post isn 't about personal finances in fact this post isn 't even going to be particularly serious in the slightest perhaps a welcome break from the drudgery we encounter on a day-to-day basis <s> This post is for those who dare to dream who occasionally or often there is no discrimination at play here have flights of fancy where they can afford whatever they please consequences be damned <s> Food <s> Everyone loves food <s> Of course there are picky eaters gluttons who eat anything and then there is the gourmet who will indulge in only the finest of fripperies wherever food is concerned <s> You 've probably guessed where this is going and it is headed in a direction in which the subject matter will revolve around the finest most expensive eating establishments in Britain avoiding the clichÈ that is the 'world is most expensive ' and instead opting for the lower-key 'just in Britain ' subtitle so maybe you 'll want to bear these in mind next time you 're booking any flights to London <s> There are no diamonds in food gemstones on cutlery-related shenanigans here for these places are expensive because well they just ARE <s> London Restaurant Gordon Ramsay Also one of the single most expensive restaurants in the world this place can set you back at least <date> for a single person and that is just selecting from the average stuff <s> If you were to opt for more exquisite dishes and then a bottle or wine or so well then you 're looking at a hefty price-tag indeed A favorite amongst locals and tourists alike provided that can afford it of course the restaurant itself is known for serving up the most palate-pleasing dishes in the whole of England is fine capital city <s> Typical delights on offer might include Cornish lamb pork belly and the finest Angus beef all mixed in with a wide range of other fine accoutrements <s> By the time you were done with this place you 'd certainly be in a better position to understand the reason behind the three Michelin Stars that have been awarded to it <s> However your wallet might not be Berkshire Waterside Inn Put on the proverbial map thanks to fantastic food a three-star Michelin chef in the form of owner Michel Roux and a 24 plum soufflÈ that made it onto the Forbes list of the world is most expensive desserts it came tenth the Waterside Inn is not only a dive into opulence but also a dive into quality as those stars aren 't awards to just anyone that comes along <s> With 'Inn ' in the title you 'd be correct in suspecting that the building housing the restaurant also serves as a place where you can for a modest sum spend a few nights <s> The restaurant is chefs serve the whole gamut of dishes you 'd expect lobster rabbit lamb duck turbot and many others each served as decadently and in an adept a fashion as you 'd imagine <s> Truly an experience for the rich in taste as well as the rich in wealth as you will most likely be set back around <date> for a two-course meal <s> London Sketch Back to the nation is capital again for meals that again breach the <date> mark <s> Sketch has long been touted as an incredibly expensive place to eat hence the gaggle of celebrities and other people of note that occasionally dine at the establishment <s> However the price doesn 't belie the quality and instead is more of an indication of it what with the restaurant itself being a product of Algerian restaurateur Mourad Mazouz and celebrated French chef Pierre Gagnaire you can rest assured that the place will contain nothing less than the most sumptuous of everything the culinary realm has to offer <s> For more travel tips and vacation inspiration check out the Tripbase Travel Blog Tripbase site <s> About Tripbase

blogspot com 3mm <date> m2ndy On Tuesday night we went to see the Garrick Theatre production of Douglas Carter Beane is The Little Dog Laughed <s> The Little Dog Laughed is about a rising Hollywood star Mitchell Rupert Friend who in the words of his agent isuffers from a slight recurring case of homosexuality ' <date> He meets rent boy Alex Harry Lloyd and their lives are turned somewhat upside down when they both fall for each other despite both asserting that they are not gay <date> The play is set against the backdrop of Hollywood and homosexuality and explores all of the double standards and difficulties with coming out in show business <date> There is a fantastic quote by Colin Firth in the programme which just about sums it up 'If you 're a straight actor who takes on the role of a gay man it is obviously not the same as being one in this business ' <s> The Little Dog Laughed was written by Douglas Carter Beane who also wrote To Wong Foo Thanks for Everything Julie Newmar a <date> film starring Patrick Swayze and Wesley Snapes <date> It first opened off-Broadway at the Second Stage Theatre in <date> <date> The play is narrated by Mitchell is morally challenged agent Diane played by Tamsin Greig who has such classic lines as quot A writer with the final cut I 'd rather give firearms to small children ' <date> It is no secret really that I am a massive fan of Harry Lloyd and have spent the past three years watching each and every one of his plays but it is Greig who absolutely steals the show and her acting wardrobe and personality all fit the role perfectly <date> In her role as Diane Greig superbly breaks through the fourth wall allowing the audience into the world of Hollywood agents actors and writers and she did it very well indeed <date> She was incredibly comfortable chatting and winking to the audience one minute and then diving right back into her encounters with the rest of the cast the next <s> Rupert Friend plays the drunken privileged and somewhat sheltered Mitchell really well <date> While I tend not to question how characters were written as it is generally a fixed factor when putting on a play I have to wonder at a rising Hollywood star who doesn 't get the significance of coming out to the world and the effect that could have on his career <date> In the end his naivetÈ is what trips him up though <s> In an equal sense Harry Lloyd is Alex just doesn 't seem to understand the dynamic of his relationship with his girl pal Ellen played by Gemma Arterton and the effect that his growing relationship with Mitchell will have on her <date> He does however utter my favourite line of the play while trying to get a point across to Mitchell 'God talking to you is like sewing a button on cottage cheese ' <s> As far as rather shallow clueless roles go Friend and Lloyd do as well as they can do but they have both taken on much better roles in the past <date> The one thing they do both handle extremely well is the intimacy and affection that develops between their two characters <date> There is a fair bit of nudity in the play with Harry Lloyd being fully nude at one point and both actors were professional and convincing in their roles <s> Gemma Arterton was far less convincing and you got the idea that she was trying to inflate her supporting role somewhat as the character definitely shrinks in comparison to the other three <date> She seemed to posture a lot and to shout her lines rather than speak them with meaning and emotion <date> She is quite inexperienced in theatre though and this certainly didn 't ruin the play <date> You have to wonder though if those in casting didn 't foresee that she would be completely overshadowed by Greig or perhaps that was the point This production of The Little Dog Laughed was directed by Jamie Lloyd and I must say he made good use of the space and actors <date> There is one invisible character so to speak who appears in one scene and speaks on the phone but is not played by anyone <date> I thought this was really well portrayed by the cast and well managed by the director <s> The set was designed by Soutra Gilmour who received an Olivier Award nomination for Best Set Design in <date> <date> While Gilmour is sets are often dark and almost sinister this was stark bare and completely white but the minimalist set worked in this play <date> The play itself is incredibly funny and highly entertaining <date> It doesn 't provide any grand answers to the problems it identifies but seems to focus more on the situation at hand and how that plays out <date> The audience was laughing along raucously at the numerous one-liners and there was much enthusiastic clapping and cheers of 'bravo ' at the end <date> All in all it was a fun night out and I 'd certainly recommend the play for people seeking a light-hearted comedy experience <s> The Little Dog Laughed is playing at the Garrick Theatre until 10 April <date> <date> There are really good prices available on tickets at <weirdcaps> com and we got tickets for <date> each from <weirdcaps> com <s> Watch The Little Dog Laughed trailer If you are reading this anywhere besides Emm in London or in an

music publication in the UK <date> Each year they showcase some of the biggest up and coming indie alternative bands in the run up to the NME Awards <date> This year The Maccabees Bombay Bicycle Club The Big Pink and The Drums hit the road on a nationwide tour and I caught them at The Brixton Academy in London <s> The Drums The Drums are a post-punk band hailing from Brooklyn New York and it is likely that you would recognise their song 'Let is Go Surfing ' <date> They are currently on a sold out tour of UK Ireland and mainland Europe and will be supporting Florence and the Machine on their nationwide tour starting in May <s> The Drums have a sound reminiscent of the punk and ska bands of the early eighties but I found them to be pretty average and unoriginal <s> I had not even heard of them before the night but certainly won 't be rushing off to buy any of their albums <date> Most importantly I have never seen a bunch of people look so uncomfortable on a stage before <date> I 've seen cheesy robotic dancing before and singers playing air drums but it is clear that The Drums have a long way to go as a band before they make that look cool <date> The Big Pink The Big Pink are the reason we went to the Shockwaves NME Awards Tour this year and it is safe to say that I am a massive fan of their album A Brief History of Love which I reviewed on <weirdcaps> in January <date> The Big Pink arrived on stage with lights and explosions and their whole set was energetic frenetic and loud <date> Their songs were much heavier than they had sounded on their CD and it was a manic mash up of squealing guitars and noise <s> I imagine that this signals a heavier direction for their new album but it could also be overcompensation for the fact that most of their music is pre-recorded and sampled <date> That meant that vocalist Robbie Furze was screaming his vocals and grinding his guitar while we debated amongst ourselves whether the bassist and drummer weren 't in fact miming <date> I am always happy for indie alternative bands to take on a heavier louder sound in fact the noisier the better as far as I am concerned <date> But this was not a great performance <date> I 've seen many bands that use heavy sampling including The Prodigy Dan le Sac vs Scroobius Pip and Faithless and it is so difficult to put on a great show in front of a massive audience when the majority of your band members are doing little on the actual night but miming <date> The Big Pink didn 't really get it right on Saturday night <s> Bombay Bicycle Club Bombay Bicycle Club hail from north London and took their name from a string of curry restaurants in the area <date> I have no idea what I expected from them before I heard them play on Saturday night as I had barely even heard of them but wasn 't in the least bit interested in listening to any of their music <s> I certainly didn 't expect to have them rock my socks off <date> Seconds into their first song I found myself debating whether to rush off to the shops the next day or order their album through Amazon <date> Thankfully such debates were soon put out of my mind as I got caught up in their energetic enthusiastic set <date> The one thing they did prove was that the problems with the previous two acts weren 't down to bad acoustics in the venue because their whole sound and lights show was fabulous <date> Jack Steadman has a fantastically unique voice and the band are confident and exciting on stage <date> Oh and they can dance <date> Perhaps the guys from The Drum need to take some dancing lessons from them <date> The crowd went mad for them and I would have to say that Bombay Bicycle Club were the best band of the night <date> It is not often that I am won over to unknown bands during a live performance but they were that good <s> The Maccabees The Maccabees played a massive fifteen song set on Saturday night and gave one of the most impressive live performances I have seen in years <date> The Maccabees are from south London but are currently based in London <date> They have five full time members but their incredible show included three musicians on brass instruments and at one stage Edwyn Collins joined them to sing 'Rip It <smiley> ' <date> The Maccabees use the whole stage and everything from their backdrop to their set up and lighting is absolutely professional and first class <date> I honestly found myself widening my eyes to try drink everything in <date> Like with Bombay Bicycle Club the sound was perfect and the crowd went absolutely mad for The Maccabees <date> They didn 't quite have the impact on me that Bombay Bicycle Club did but that is not to say that they weren 't brilliant <date> They were really good and I 'd definitely go see them again sometime <s> After a rocky start the <weirdcaps> NME Awards Tour <date> was a huge success and Bombay Bicycle Club and The Maccabees certainly made up for a slightly shaky start <date> The best thing about the O2 Brixton Academy of course is that after the show we were able to nip into Nandos for some chicken burgers thus avoiding the British tradition of the post-night out dodgy vindaloo <s> If you are

Asparagus istirs up lust in man and woman 'wrote a 17th century herbalist <s> Asparagus is a great source of potassium fiber vitamin B6 vitamins A and C and thiamin and folic acid <s> Folic acid is known for boosting histamine production necessary for the ability to reach orgasm in both sexes <s> You 'll find the best asparagus dish in the city at Riposo 72 <s> The sleeper wine bar on the Upper West Side grills its asparagus and wraps them in prosciutto and a thin layer of melted parmesan <s> It is to die for 9 <s> Avocado Like the asparagus the avocado is rich in folic acid <s> And just look at it <s> Its shape alone is sexual <s> So much so that Catholic priests in Spain once forbade it <s> The best way to eat avocado is sliced on a sandwich in sushi or chopped up in guacamole <s> For the first head to Cafe Ronda for their chipotle sandwich with chicken onions and avocados <s> For sushi head to <weirdcaps> for their salmon avocado roll <s> You 'll find the best guacamole in the city at Mama Mexico on the Upper West Side or at any Rosa Mexicano location <s> The freshly-made guac is the stuff and both of these Mexican-themed restaurants chop the avocado right in front of you 8 <s> Bananas In a 'ition to potassium bananas contain chelating minerals and the bromeliad enzyme that are believed to enhance the male libido <s> Look at your significant other start pealing one and eat it in front of him or her with a straight face <s> Have fun with that <s> The only bananas I 've eaten in this city excluding the ones for 60 cents at my office cafeteria have been on pancakes <s> Head to Norma is for a sick short stack <s> Their banana-macadamia nut flap jacks with whipped banana and brown sugar butter are off the charts 7 <s> Foie Gras I 've never been a huge fan of foie gras or how they treat the ducks in the process but if you 're a Francophile in search of some loving hit up Bar Boulud <s> They have an excellent selection of foie gras and pates <s> Try their country pate foie gras with truffle juice and port <s> Whether it is the ingredients or the fine food is mystique that grabs you if eating it makes you feel sexy go for it 6 <s> Basil Smelling basil alone puts me under <s> Head to Kuma Inn for their steamed edamame with Thai basil-lime oil <s> If you prefer going the Italian route head to Gradisca for a couple of options <s> Not only is this one of my favorite Italian spots in the city but it is romantic as well and you can try their caprese salad with basil or the cavatelli pasta with tomato eggplant and basil 5 <s> Pine Nuts Pine nuts are high in zinc -- a mineral necessary to maintain male potency <s> Kefi has an incredible dish with pine nuts the sheep is milk dumplings with tomatoes pine nuts and warm soft feta <s> If I could I would eat at Kefi once a week <s> An alternative to the dumplings would be Frederick is caprese salad with pine nuts sprinkled on top 4 <s> Chocolate Chocolate contains chemicals thought to effect neurotransmitters in the brain <s> The Aztecs once called chocolate the 'nourishment of the gods 'Sfoglia serves an incredible pasta dish with chocolate its gnocchi with mushroom and chocolate shavings <s> If you 'd rather have chocolate in a sexy dessert head to Artisanal for their romantic chocolate fondue 3 <s> Garlic The 'heat 'in garlic is said to stir sexual desires <s> I eat garlic in just about anything but one of my favorite dishes in the city is at Esperanto <s> They serve mussels on the half shell roasted with garlic topped with parmesan and paprika <s> Pair the mussels with one of Esperanto is exceptional Brazilian cocktails and you 're sure to score big this weekend <s> Good also flaunts its mussels with tons of garlic in a 'ition to white wine herbs and grilled country bread 2 <s> Wine We all know red wine can be awfully seductive and this city has its fair share of places to find it <s> Though wine bars have a rather effeminate sound to them don 't fear gents bring your gal to one of these low-key spots and you 'll be a hit <s> Riposo 72 makes it on the aphrodisiac list twice <s> You don 't even have to taste the wine here to feel sexy -- you 'll feel hot just holding their huge wine glasses <s> Their cozy warm atmosphere is heavy on the romance as well <s> Taste is another favorite of mine for vino <s> For more generous pours head to i Trulli Peasant Bar Boulud Grape and Grain and clo wine bar at Columbus Circle <s> If you want to stay in with your honey head to Morrell is in Rockefeller Center or 67 Wine for my two favorite wine stores in the city 1 <s> Oysters The Romans were the first to label oysters as an aphrodisiac <s> There are many places to find oysters in New York City <s> The best in my book is Aquagrill in the West Village <s> Some runners-up would be Grand Central Oyster Bar Jack is Luxury Oyster Bar and Morimoto <s> If you 're in the mood for surf and turf grab some oysters at my new favorite steakhouse Keen is 'ARE YOU ALIVE <punctuationfreak> WHEN CAN WE GET DINNER <punctuationfreak> 'asked <weirdcaps> <s> She is always so dramatic <s> She produces a cable news show and they type the rundown in all caps and I think she forgets to turn off her work type from time to time <s> I still love her <s> <weirdcaps> sent me a few of these e-mails starting back in November and it took us until the first week in January to get together <s> She always has a wish list of places to try -- a few years back she had an Excel spreadsheet -- so I asked her to e-mail me the ones at the top of this list <s> Excel or no excel when I saw Momofuku Ssam Bar on the list I got fired up <s> Johnny Depp is to the Academy Award as I formerly was to David Chang is restaurants If you don 't know Chang please read this article before you proceed <s> You will not regret it <s> I wish Larissa <weirdcaps> did profiles on all of New York City chefs <s> I 've had a crush on the guy ever since Momofuku restaurants have been eluding me for years <s> Much like Babbo once was to me the restaurants in the Momofuku family had an unattainable quality to them <s> I would hear someone asking if I 'd tried Momofuku Ko if I liked Momofuku Noodle Bar if I wanted to go to Ssam Bar and I 'd throw my head back roll my eyes and give them a loud ' <repeatedchars> Good luck 'I am the first to admit that if a restaurant is notoriously hard to get into I will avoid it at all costs or wait around until it is uncool to try it <s> Sadly neither Momofuku Ssam Bar nor any of its sister restaurants are getting any uncooler so <weirdcaps> gave me the kick in the pants I needed to swallow my ferocious pride and give it a whirl <s> There was one slight problem <s> Over the past four months I 've been eating strictly vegetarian <s> I feared eating at one of Chang is spots would be a total disaster <s> I even asked my Twitter followers and eaterny if there was a point in me trying Momofuku Ssam Bar <s> The responses were mixed <s> One person wrote don 't go to momo if you 're a vegetarian there are better choices <s> Another wrote pork buns and spicy rice cakes and compost cookies <s> Drool <s> While a third wrote There are fish options and a veg or 3 <s> I consulted the menu and it looked doable <s> We would dine at Momofuku Ssam Bar despite <weirdcaps> being concerned about her having to eat all the meat dishes by herself <s> I told her she 'd live <s> I showed up at 8 <math> ish <s> The place was a zoo yet the hostess came and found me like a magnet <s> When I told her I was waiting for my friend running late from work she pointed me in the direction of the Milk Bar and said she 'd come in to check on me to see if my second party had arrived <s> I couldn 't get over how friendly she was <s> I was surprised by the simplicity of the decor in Ssam Bar <s> The tables were like picnic benches with an Asian flare <s> The chairs were backless <s> Folks at tables were to the right side and there weren 't a lot of them and to the other side was the bar <s> It seemed like some of the tables were communal <s> Both the bar and table areas took up an equal amount of space in the dining room <s> The decor wasn 't the hype here or the coziness <s> The food was <s> Backless chairs don 't lend well to settling in and hanging around for hours <s> The horizontal wood paneling and table design reminded me of that of the Chelsea pizzeria Co <s> I wasn 't entirely sure what the hostess meant by the Milk Bar <s> I knew it was attached but visually I couldn 't see what she meant <s> I just kept following the narrow space between the bar and the tables saw the bright light of the open kitchen at the far end of the dining room and found another hallway <s> At the end of this hallway there were large groups of people standing in line for bakery items ranging from cookies and cakes to ice cream and soft serve <s> I guess it doubled as the waiting room <s> I plopped my pur-ggage on the table with a thud and made it clear I 'd be staying for a while <s> I whipped out Julia Child is 'My Life in France 'and began to alternate between reading a few paragraphs and checking out the commotion around me <s> I heard about four different accents in the span of 20 minutes Bostonian Australian German and French <s> This place was no secret to foreigners <s> Everyone knew and idolized Chang <s> The four young <math> something dudes behind me were drooling over what pork plate they were going to get how Chang is fried chicken was 'bad ass 'and how they wanted a compost cookie for later <s> What the hell was a compost cookie I looked up and saw it had pretzels potato chips butterscotch coffee oats and chocolate and any other crumbs lying around the kitchen Chang and his chefs could find <s> This was right up my alley <s> A petite blond college student in front of me was going on and on to her two friends about balancing studying with her long-distance boyfriend and how she was really more into hooking up locally with randoms than having a committed relationship with someone who was far away <s> Her boring 'far away aman was in Boston <s> I was tempted to blurt out her ridiculous whining on Overheardinnewyork com but I decided to continue reading instead <s> Where was <weirdcaps> The hostess came to check on me at least one more time before <weirdcaps> arrived <s> I couldn 't believe how incredible the service was <s> She could have just dumped me in the back and waited for me to come find her when <weirdcaps> got there but no <s> She kept her word and made sure I was still solo <s> When <weirdcaps> did come she went and found our hostess <s> I almost told her not to worry she was looking out for us but I was getting pretty hungry at this point after all the compost talk so if <weirdcaps> could expedite the seat process I 'd be thrilled 'Mona 'She waved at me at the end of the hallway connecting the Milk Bar to Ssam 'Really Ready Coming 'I shoved my book and gloves and hat and scarf in my pur-ggage and flew off to start our Ssam adventure <s> We snagged a great front seat at the bar <s> This was perfect <s> We could look at the menu ask questions and watch the bartenders at work -- one of my favorite things to do 'So <s> I need an update <s> Like NOW 'OK OK <s> Christmas was incredible <s> We had the best time 'I replied 'Can I get you guys a drink 'Asked a tall thin guy with a chunk of his blond hair spiked in the front and pointing off to the right like an arrow <s> He was wearing an interesting two-toned green T-shirt and when he stepped away it reminded me of the old hyper-color tees 'Oh shoot <s> We haven 't gotten that far yet 'I responded 'OK let is choose our drinks and then you 'll tell me what happene 'dsaid <weirdcaps> <s> <weirdcaps> told me about a drink she 'd had recently called a French 75 <s> Her version was made of Champagne gin though some recipes call for cognac or brandy and lemon juice <s> We asked the bartender if he could make one <s> There were cocktails with Champagne on the menu but he had an idea they weren 't supposed to use Champagne for cocktails they didn 't have on the menu <s> It sounded strange to us but he was very smiley and friendly so we didn 't think twice about it <s> I asked him about the seasonal pickle brine martini with Plymouth gin <s> To this dirty martini nut it sounded delish <s> I chose the classic with gin and <weirdcaps> went with a vodka version 'OK <s> Spill it 'So we met at our friend is we 'ing -- 'Dude <s> I know that part <s> Fast forward to more recent ishe ordered 'Ha OK OK <s> I don 't remember what you know and what you don 't know <s> We 've seen each other four times now <s> He came to New York once and I went to Los Angeles twice-- 'So you met him and you 've seen him three times since and you 're totally gonzo <punctuationfreak> 'I know I know <s> It must sound totally insane <s> But I am totally insane about him <s> If you asked me to describe my dream man physically and emotionally it would be him <s> I just feel so lucky 'I am so happy for you 'Christmas was a total whirlwind <s> We went whale-watching with his parents <s> Our parents met at dinner <s> Everyone got along super well <s> I spent a week with the fam and then I flew down to L <s> A to be with him for four days <s> It was so awesome 'Wow ishe responded 'Do you guys have any questions about the menu 'Oh we haven 't even looked <s> Sorry 'Let is pick out food and we 'll keep talking after isuggested <weirdcaps> 'Done and done 'We looked at the menu and there were a bunch of items that jumped out at us <s> We tried as much as we could between two girls one being a vegetarian <s> As our first cocktails dried up the bartender informed us he 'd inquired about making the French 75 and that he could in fact use the champagne for items not on the drinks menu <s> It was very sweet of him to pursue this further because we had certainly forgotten so we ordered up a round of French 75s and kept ogling at the menu <s> We copied our neighbors and tried the cured hamachi with edamame horseradish and pea leaves <s> The horseradish was charred black and I could have eaten the crumbles by the pint <s> The hamachi was light and fresh with an edamame sauce <s> The horseradish saved this dish from being bland <s> Next we tried the cracked Jonah crab claws with harissa mayo <s> Like I mentioned below at Choptank crab claws don 't really do it for me <s> I tried to suck all the meat and juice out of the smallest claw and it was a lot of work for not a lot of substance <s> Next time I eat a crab it 'll be a full sucker <s> <weirdcaps> wasn 't impressed either <s> <weirdcaps> tried the steamed pork buns with hoisin cucumbers and scallions <s> Ever since eating at Kuma Inn I 've loved the white gooey almost marshmallow-like bun with pork belly <s> I kept to my vegetarian ways and just tried a sliver of the foamy bread and wished I could have had a plain side of the bun <s> I bet if I 'd asked I could have <s> Rats <s> We finished up with the bread and butter plate with two types of butter sea salt from Vermont and whipped lardo <s> The bread was disappointing <s> It was thick and heavy on the tough crust with too little soft on the inside <s> Maybe Chang should outsource the one thing he is not an expert in -- French bread sorry FCI <s> <smiley> 'il est deja en train de faire ceci je suis tres desole <s> The butter however was ridiculous especially the lardo <s> It was so rich it could have been cheese <s> I almost wanted to eat it plain with a spoon <s> I knew it would give me a heart attack so I refrained but man <s> Who knew butter could be so flavorful Chang <s> That is who <s> Last and definitely not least we tried the fried brussels sprouts with mint and a fish sauce vinaigrette <s> With all the hype surrounding Momofuku we hadn 't been all that moved by the food until the brussels sprouts <s> I don 't care if you 've never liked or tried a brussels sprout in your life this is one of New York is finest dishes <s> No joke <s> I couldn 't figure out if I wanted to just inhale them or eat them slowly so they 'd last longer <s> A couple sitting next to us asked what they should get and besides the pork belly and the hamachi I yelled with brussels sprouts hanging out of my mouth 'THUH BRUHTHULL THPROUTHS 'So Tell me more about <weirdcaps> <punctuationfreak> 'Throughout dinner it was a battle to consume what was in front of us and each other is lives over the past six months 'So what is it about him Mona 'I think I have a face now whenever someone mentions him <s> It is called <weirdcaps> face and I get called out on it constantly <s> I light up like the tree and ice skating rink at Rockefeller Center 'I always told my mom I

It was a huge relief that what I was saying wasn 't gibberish 'Right <punctuationfreak> Yet at the same time he is a complete love a total softie <s> So anyway he is amazing and there isn 't a second of any day where I don 't doubt or question what he is thinking or feeling <s> Because he tells me all the time <s> It is never a mystery <s> And he lives across the country I dated someone who I practically lived with who never said the sweet things <weirdcaps> says to me <s> I really can 't 'Mona ' believe how lucky I am to have found 'Mona ' him <s> I just feel so 'Mona 'Oh god sorry <s>

dinner thanked our bartender profusely for taking such good care of us and headed to the Milk Bar for some dessert <s> <weirdcaps> had tried the cookies before and kept saying 'blueberry blueberry blueberry 'in my ear <s> I barely like fruit as it is so the thought of eating blueberries in a cookie just sounded borderline revolting <s> <weirdcaps> teases me for being the only vegetarian he knows who doesn 't like vegetables and fruit <s> After staring at the blackboard for a good solid five minutes and not really registering what was happening I gave in <s> We went with the blueberry and cream cookie and the compost cookie <s> These are the only two cookies you 're allowed to try if you go to Chang is Milk Bar <s> They were soft gooey chewy and I wanted to wrap myself in them <s> Just how a cookie ought to be 'We 're not the best cooks 'Chang once told The New Yorker back in March <date> 'We 're not the best restaurant -- if you were a really good cook you wouldn 't be working here because really good cooks are a--holes <s> But we 're gonna try our best and that is as a team 'Chang is no bulls <math> artist <s> And his food is no bulls <math> either <s> I don 't know if I 'll ever be ready to fight the minions to get into Momofuku Ko but I am psyched to know I can count on a bar stool at Ssam for brussels sprouts lardo a strong cocktail great service and a warm compost cookie for dessert <s> Drool indeed <date> 2 Avenue at 13th St <date> <date> Worked on this opus for 12 long hours yesterday <s> I found some great new friends on the Web while reaching out to some

wanted Fashionista to meet Sunkist and after a full day of back-to-back dance classes I knew Sunkist would be up for a good hearty meal <s> Sunkist and I went to school together in Charlottesville and we moved to Snowmass Colo after <date> <s> Sunkist went from being the star of Aspen is Crystal Palace to producing her own children is plays in Aspen <s> She is opening up a dance studio as well and part of her goal in coming to New York was to brushen up on some of the hottest trends in dance <s> I could devote an entire post to our hip hop class at the Ailey Dance Studio but I 'll save that humiliation and embarrassment for only my closest friends and the unlucky passersby who got to watch my sorry butt wiggle and wag in the Ailey fishbowl studio <s> Unfortunately Sunkist had a class that night that went until nine <s> Reservations were at 8 30 'We can shower at the studio so we can be quick to meet up ishe texted <s> I don 't think Sunkist understood the whole New York

was the first one to show up at Choptank <s> Since I 'd been the annoying friend adjusting and readjusting our reservation I was not going to be the annoying late friend <s> I walked in and felt sort

The entrance space was straight up awkward <s> The bar behind the check-in table was a good four or five stairs up from ground level <s> They should have expanded the bar further towards the window and increased their stool surface area while decreasing the over-sized pointless space in front <s> As soon as Fashionista <weirdcaps> and BYOWino arrived we exchanged hugs left our tired winter coats with a host and headed off to our table <s> The main dining area scored high on the cool meter <s> Choptank was dominated by its two huge square-shaped bars in the mi 'le of the room <s> The space with tables and those who weren 't cool enough to make the cut at bar seats seemed like a lame after-thought <s> If you go to Choptank eat at the bar <s> I immediately wished I was meeting one person instead of three so I could sit in front of the bartenders drink out of a big wine glass and stare at the oysters all night <s> The place was completely packed yet somehow we scored the best table in

there right The man said pointing at our building -Yes -And you are moving out very soon -Yes -That is what I thought <s> So today I brought this 3 ladies to show them your flat He proudly gestured to three small ladies at his right side - <repeatedchars> -Can we go and see it now <punctuationfreak> One lady asked - Er we are going to Shanghai I said no 'ing towards my large shoulder bag - Ah OK said the man <s> But can 't you show us the flat before you go -We don 't have time We are catching the train -Oh no time <s> The wax man sounded seriously disappointed - What time is your train one of the women said <s> I am sure you have time to show us the flat before that -The train is leaving quite soon we have to go now actually I said <s> We don 't have time to show you our flat <smiley> 'How about calling first <punctuationfreak> ' I wanted to screem -That is a shame the wax man said looking at us as if we were enemies <s> So when will you be back then <punctuationfreak> Just as if we had broken a non-existent appointment <punctuationfreak> - Well we are ah why don 't you just call me next time <punctuationfreak> My bf said - Ah <s> OK <s> You want me to call you <s> I understand the wax man said -A re you sure you don 't have time to show us the flat One of the ladies urged <s> You will still make your train <s> It is fast to get to the train station from here They all smiled and one of them attempted to pull my sleeve <s> I gave her a dark look <s> Enough with the bull-sh-t <s> And we left <s> Just imagine that huh You take three ladies on a house hunt on a Saturday afternoon however you forget to inform the current tenants so instead you jump on the first laowais you see on a parking lot <punctuationfreak> our living area is huge there are at least 40 buildings in there <s> Fortunately they are the 'right ones ' Then you try and convince them to show you their flat even though you know they 'll miss their train if they linger <punctuationfreak> If that is not random I don 't know what is <punctuationfreak> One would think this was a serious aerobic class in full throttle <s> And I guess it was <s> But not for everyone Apparently the aerobic class with bom-ba-da-bom-tunes blasting from the speakers was also a perfect place for reading a book Who would have guessed <punctuationfreak> Not me anyway When I say I need a run I mean it I 've had a bit of a rough week with a lot of stuff going on making my mood anything but stable <s> Yesterday I decided that no matter how much work there was on my desk by the end of the day I would still hit the gym in order to burn some energy <s> I kept my promise but just as I was about to leave for the gym a strange feeling hit me <s> Did I really pack all my training clothes I decided to have a look and very well <s> I had packed all my training clothes except for a sport is bra <s> There is no way on earth that I will hit a gym wearing a normal bra so the remaining question was could I bother going home picking up a sport is bra and then head back to the gym It is definitely not on the way rather I live in the opposite direction However after a moment of mental self-consulting I decided that I very well could <s> So I went home found what I needed spent extra time on a crammed metro and arrived at the gym one hout later than planned but hyped about the thought of hitting the treadmill <s> I had dinner plans at 8pm so I went over to the reception and asked to 'rent ' a towel a 5 kuai so that I could shower and head out straight after my workout <s> Imagine my surprise when the RUDE guy behind the desk said -No towels today <s> If it would have been any other day I might have shrugged my shoulders and left slightly annoyed <s> This particular day however his words made me see red -That is IMPOSSIBLE That is not OKAY I need a towel <s> I NEED TO WORK OUT again I normally don 't yell at people but - Well sorry we don 't have any -No this is not okay <s> You always have towels <s> If you su 'enly decide not to have towels you need to inform your customers in advance so that we can bring some ourselves I didn 't bring a towel today just because I thought I could 'rent ' one from here -Well -Well you have to find me a towel <s> I am not leaving <s> I need a towel otherwise I cannot workout -Eh maybe you should speak to the manager -Yeah where is he or she -Eh he will come in 3 min <s> I waited for 3 minutes feeling angrier by the minute <s> I simply refused to just go home The reception guy was really annoying - I know this situation is really annoying he said it in a sarcastic way - VERY -Why don 't you go and workout first have a shower and THEN come and see if we have found you a towel -WHAT <punctuationfreak> How am I going to shower without a towel <punctuationfreak> I wanted to say 'do you want me to walk out naked and ask if you have now found me a towel <punctuationfreak> 'but I don 't know the Chinese word for naked so I left it like that I guess his suggestion here was 'why don 't you do like all the other girls at this gym and dry yourself off with the hairdryer once you come out of the shower ' <s> Then 2 girls su 'enly arrived manager <s> The reception guy told the girls they needed to find 'this laowai ' pointing at me a towel - There are no towels the girls said - There HAVE to be towels I know there are somewhere I don 't care what kind you just have to find me a towel -But there are no -Please <s> Try The girls sighed rolled her eyes and went away only to come back 30 seconds later <s> Carrying a LARGE WHITE TOWEL - Oh I found one <s> Oh my oh my <s> At that point however I was too relieved to continue bitching about their lousy attitude towards problem solving I simply accepted the towel and went to the ladies changing room <s> Once at the gym all the treadmills were busy <s> However I didn 't even consider the thought of giving up this workout or settling for anything else but running <s> I simply located a girl who was walking along to a clock ticking down she only had 4 min left and I was rude enough to stand behind her and wait for her to finish and get off <s> A number of people realized what I was doing <s> Some laughed some pointed and some tried to sneak in between when they realized the girl would be done soon But I was faster and once I got up there I enjoyed the best 7km run I 've done in ages <repeatedchars> <s> <repeatedchars> Once I made that 8pm dinner I felt rather proud of myself and my nagging-attitude <s> If there is a will there is a way this appeals to most of the 'impossible

least during the morning rush that more and more people nowadays stand on the right hand side of escalators <punctuationfreak> That way it is almost as efficient Hold your horses I said almost as the London underground system where I believe you stand to the left but I might be wrong where you literally get walked over if you accidently stand on the 'walking hand side ' of the escalator <s> Of course there are still a few cases of people OK not just a few more like some millions standing on the left hand side when you come walking but with a gentle push tap on the shoulder a good <math> immediately move to the side to let you through <s> Good stuff Unfortunately not all people are as friendly helpful <s> I 've had cases where I 've gently tapped the other person is shoulder in <math> of the cases it is been mi 'le-aged Chinese men and said something like ' <punctuationfreak> bu haoyisi pardon me ' indicating I want to be let through <s> But do they move Oh no <punctuationfreak> In one case the man turned around looked at me and stood like a brick of stone on his spot refusing to even let me squeeze between him and that person to the right When he started pushing me back with violence I decided to give up <s> Still a great improvement from previous years so Shanghai metro I have hope One thing I still wish people could relax a little bit about is getting on off the metro <s> The other day we had a work-dinner after work and me and a few colleagues caught the metro just one stop to get to the restaurant <s> We were a group of five and since the metro was quite full we stood just at the door <s> I immediately felt the push from behind some guy that tried to squeeze in between us to stand JUST at the door so I turned around and told him that we too were getting off at the next station <s> He looked like he understood and for a short second he stood back until something must have hit him maybe that eagerness to STAND at the DOOR so he still decided to elbow his way through our little group and catch the spot JUST at the door Guess he 'd been taught never to trust laowais <s> The funniest cases are still all those people that push like mad in the metro RUN off the metro as if their houses were on fire and then finally when they get to the escalator they just stand there rather than continuing moving upwards <s> Speaking off the metro Shanghai is new metro system with new lines and plenty of new stations is simply G-R-E-A-T N-E-W-S- I am loving every little bit of it especially line 7 that is now connected to Line 1 is Changshu Lu <s> Simply great <s> Me and my significant other are planning a metro-exploring weekend someday in April May when you don 't freeze your fingers off every time you step out the door where we are going to spend 2 days

sounds you actually get to see quite a lot of new stuff <s> I promise to report back to you afterwards <s> Whatever you do -as a girl- only pay attention to the guys Sometimes China is just so funny <s> While western guys can receive an unlimited amount of compliments over here from men as well as from women there is a clear line when it comes to women <s> The other day I went shopping with four Chinese girlfriends <s> We are not super close but have known each other for some years still <s> They are all a bit younger than me and especially one of them her name is Luna really likes me and the fact that I am tall blonde and big-nosed <s> We went into some shops and were all trying on clothes <s> I had one of those good and rare days when everything fits and my dear friend Luna simply would not hold back on the compliments -Ah Jonna you look so great in everything you try on today -That is perfect on you -You 've got a great figure I was blushing 'nail-nali-ing ' 'bu gandang-ing ' and so on yeah accepting a compliment is simply not my thing especially not here in China until one of the other Chinese girls decided she 'd had enough - What is the matter with you Luna the way you speak to Jonna one would think you have a crush on her <punctuationfreak> -Come on I am just saying she looks good in this dress -No you 're not <s> I think you like her -Yeah I think you do Another one filled in <s> You 've been speaking to her as if you like her all day long Yikes <s> Uncomfortable situation number ONE <s> Chinese girls are fighting over if one of them has a crush on me or not <punctuationfreak> And all she did was paying me some compliments -I don 't come on -Well so how come you don 't have a boyfriend -I have not found one I like -Well maybe you like girls <s> Maybe you have a big problem -Hahhaha well well shall we all go for lunch <punctuationfreak> I decided it was time to step in and change the subject -and what better way to do so than distract them with lunch <s> However the conversations continued over the food when Luna asked me if I wanted to try her salmon pasta we were having a Wagas lunch - <repeatedchars> you totally like her <punctuationfreak> You 've got a problem You like girls Both me and Luna sighed <s> Man There is no way to get a compliment over here is there What a weekend Since I 've now been living in Shanghai for 2 months we decided that it was time to throw a small housewarming party <s> Now housewarming parties are not really a unique kind so in order to do something different we decided to have a theme at our party namely 'bad taste ' Shopping proved to be the best part of it all <s> We headed straight to the small shops on Fuxing Lu where I tried on everything from flower-power pants to zebra meets leopard dresses <s> I eventually settled for a skintight golden leopard shirt a high-waist black gold skirt and a silver snakeskin jacket that was way too small for me <s> All in all I looked like jungle girl going disco <s> My bf picked his outfit from another shop <s> We knew straight away that it was going to be fun because the moment we walked in the sale is girl went ballistic - OH MY GOSH <punctuationfreak> You are the most handsome man I have ever seen She gushed to my boyfriend <s> She followed him around stroking his arms giggling and picking out stuff for him to try <s> She had no idea that we were going for something rather tacky and that we therefore actually kind of liked the stuff she picked and said ' <repeatedchars> ' and 'perfect ' to every single shiny garment that he agreed on trying on <s> In the end he went for a gray silver sequence suit jacket a check-patterned hat a tight t-shirt and some golden jewellery chains <s> He looked like a complete yuppie and the sale is girl looked like she was going to pass out on the spot - Oh my Gosh You look SO GOOD <punctuationfreak> We laughed so hard we didn 't know what to do <s> While he was paying the sale is girl turned to me - Is he your boyfriend -Yes -Oh my GOSH You are so lucky SO LUCKY I admire you -He is indeed very popular in China -Well he is the most handsome man I have seen And you You too are very long look at me special -Special -Yes in fact <s> I like the both of you -That is nice of you to say -I love your nose -My nose small moment of hesitation -It is the biggest and most beautiful nose I have ever seen I had to bite my lip not to have an uncontrolled laugh fit -Ehum right <s> Eh thanks She waved goodbye when we left opening the door and yelling - Come back soon You are my favourite laowai couple <punctuationfreak> After us <s> We were high on laughter as we hit the streets <s> The party itself was a blast despite an insane number of strange cancellations from our friends 2 girls confessed they were preggers and couldn 't make it one guy confessed his girlfriend was preggers and that he was going to Korea to get married one girl had to work another one thought it was raining too hard outside and then one guy broke his arm in an ice-hockey game the night before <punctuationfreak> Hahaha We still managed to pull a crowd however and ended up having a great time <s> People had really made an effort and one guy actually showed up in a dinosaur costume <s> My boyfriend was a hit in his pimp-outfit meanwhile my Chinese girlfriends expressed their disappointment in me -Jonna you actually look good in those clothes <s> I would totally wear that on a night out <punctuationfreak> Go out as the golden meets silver jungle-disco girl <punctuationfreak> well I shouldn 't say too much because that is exactly what I did some drinks later <s> I guess our taste levels are different Bad taste party calls for bad taste-snacks we picked these up at our local bakery <repeatedchars>

hand is a clear indication of completion and enables the writer to let it go <s> MC said that film cannot capture an inner life as well a a book but SM pointed out that one is inner life occurs in images not words <s> But then they spoke of shared delights in the making of the film like watching Meryl Streep and Vanessa Redgrave on a monitor outside the house and being amazed to see them step into character and switch it on discarding their natural selves in a flash <s> They talked about filming at a Newport house of that genre known as a 'cottage 'that belongs to the Cushing family rather than in Maine as in the book which would have proven overwhelmingly expensive to produce <s> They concurred on the problem of turning an entire book into a movie where films are really short stories and the more sympathetic form for adapting a novel into image format is a television series <s> MC spoke fondly of squabbling with cinematographer and director Lajos Koltai over lines about which he had second thoughts but that Koltai wanted to keep <s> SM spoke about about Eileen Atkins having trouble with the cadence of the lines until SM explained that the nurse was Irish <s> They both spoke

the afternoon and realized that I had missed this year is Kips Bay Show House which was being dismantled <s> Volunteering there had been one of my favorite 'rites 'of Spring for longer than I care to admit but it is been more than seven years since I turned my attention to another event that raises funds for the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club <s> The Show House I missed was hosted by the brilliant Janna Bullock and RIGroup <s> This was a very different undertaking from what it once was when I was one of a band of perhaps twenty young women who took turns watching the rooms under the auspices of the original Show House Committee <s> The Committee never changed from year to year but were always there from dawn till dusk in Chanel suits and ropes of pearls fresh as proverbial daisies and well into their seventies-- or so it seemed to me <s> The air was always scented with Rigaud candles and flowers which competed with paint and varnish that was not yet cured <s> There were fads for peonies one year orchids the next and air plants another <s> One had to know what the antiques and paint finishes were to explain them to visitors and and make sure nobody fainted from climbing the stairs as all the terrible things that can happen on elevators weren 't covered in the insurance contracts <s> Once Mrs <s> Mazzola decided to climb to the top and work her way down and had to sit down at the top floor landing which called for procedures reserved for extreme emergencies in terms of the arrangements of those days <s> Luckily a Chinese garden stool came in handy until a proper chair could be brought <s> Climbing the beautiful staircases two and three steps at a time was a special treat for me and the main reason I always went back <s> I was new to New York and missed staircases especially those massive marble ones with low risers in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century houses of my hometown Calcutta on which one could jump about and play games <s> Between chasing up and down these newer but equally generous staircases I enjoyed the fact that the visitors were colorful international dressed up and wore great shoes <s> My first happy moment of extra responsibility came one year in the first and grandest house which was on 66th Street and belonged at the time to Imelda Marcos who lent it every year for the Show House <s> In the main drawing room situated on the second floor as in a piano nobile Robert Metzger had set up an early multi-channel music system around the edges of the room which featured a lush over-the-top eighties version of period decor with plenty of silk damask and passementerie the console being cleverly tucked away iirc in cabinet with Boulle marquetry or similar <s> I was required to stand by a massive flower arrangement on a round table in the center of the room under a magnificent Russian chandelier smile at visitors and explain the rug and I noticed that both speakers deployed to the west were playing the same channel as were the ones to the east <s> To my enormous delight RM allowed me to pull out the console after the House closed for the day fi 'le with the wiring and fix it <s> That would never be done today as the firms who do the sound would first of all never make that kind of mistake and the House would certainly never allow a volunteer to touch the wiring <s> A few years later at the first Show House at <date> Park also the last chaired by the legendary Rella <weirdcaps> I got to be her right hand gal at the entrance where she handled tickets herself every day transforming that job into a subtle performance that required her great wit <s> That year the pantry with its green-shaded light big silver safe and humongous ancient icebox was just cleaned up because the idea was still only to present a decorated house and the pantry was a perfect relic <s> One day during that run Mrs <s> <weirdcaps> was hurrying to the Show House when a bag lady as we called them then stopped her to ask for help <s> Rella being as warm-hearted as she was elegant asked what she could do for her <s> The bag lady sai ' <weirdcaps> you hold up this mirror for me 'and while Rella did that the bag lady rummaged about her shopping bag drew out and carefully put on a set of big false lashes <s> The house at <date> Park is one room deep but quite wide with a long long Park Avenue facade and commensurate taxes so it stayed on the market for a long time to become the default Show House for Kips Bay and other causes for some years <s> Thierry DËspont created a memorable decor in the paneled room there but I can 't remember whether it was for Kips Bay or the American Hospital in Paris <s> Although pictures of rooms from recent years are available online now rooms that came before live only in one is memories and in the old journals-- a stack of which were lost to me in a heist upstate in which I lost about a thousand books as well <s> What remains in my head Mark Hampton is cream white and sisal drawing room on 66th Street with the bureau plat placed like a sofa table in which all the fine Georgian mahogany became beautifully abstracted The grand yet hilarious dining room that Ruben de Saavedra created at 62nd Street where the fabric hung walls were drawn aside at mirrored intervals for busts of laughing moors to peek out Richard Ridge is almost completely lavender bedroom which a band of his friends left in a group all crying out 'Nurse ' the narrow room at 1 East 94th Street that J <s> Allen Murphy dressed in yellow and Benarasi gold brocade including an unraveled paghri as a pelmet hung with Mughal lanterns which he dedicated to the Raj Mata of Jaipur <s> She came to look and I was embarrassed to see her at Doubles while I was still wearing a dress from volunteering so un-Indian and deeply frowned upon then though pants were fine Richard Ridge is dining room in which the Romney had been cleaned to within a micron of its life the large bedroom that John Saladino turned into a frescoed bathroom with a brass punkhah so insulted was he not to have gotten a drawing room according to my friend who used to work for him <s> Recent memorable rooms include Odile de Schietere is Venetian drawing room with furniture from FerriËres Michael Simon is dix-huitiËme in black the cleanest stable in creation by Andrew Tedesco Larry Laslo is black bedroom where the black Baccarat chandelier made its New York dÈbut <s> Diantha Nype was another reason I was there <s> Diantha had left Bryn Mawr to get married which is like leaving Hogwarts to become a muggle but then she out-Mawr-ed everybody by inventing the Show House-- it really was her idea to start with although this will remain forever unsung because it is totally not the credo to claim this kind of credit considering how many other people have worked long and hard to make it happen <s> Nevertheless start it she did and so all show houses that exist sprouting across the nation every spring and fall -- to Diantha we owe this most excellent concept <s> Of all the original Committee it was she who was always second in command to Rella she who a 'ressed the robbery and she who created the public image of the Show House as it is was and ever shall be <s> Anyway having missed the new Show House and missing the brio of the old days it was a very happy touch of deja vue to see what Matthew Sudock of M Design has done at David Burke Donatella where I met C for lunch <s> The mix of Hicks in carpet and screens with creamy walls plain mirrors backlit red dry arrangement large and loopy chandeliers cheery cherry leather seating and gigantic bouquets of red-and white striped trumpet lilies all scaled for a nice tall New York brownstone reminded me of the panache the hint of improv and inventive flair of the old days <s> The food is great and playful too and the tuna and salmon tartare not to be missed English-speaking people who are deaf to aspirates and aspirated consonants in Indian languages can 't say ghee and tend to produce incorrect spellings like Ghandi and Dehli <s> Because of this speech impediment the word sipahi meaning soldier in Persian and Urdu became sepoy for the British who gave this misheard word currency by giving the Indian uprising of <date> against themselves a misleading nickname --The Sepoy Mutiny <s> The Uprising involved not only huge numbers of mercenary Indian soldiers under British pay and command but also Indian princes their subjects of various classes their armies and camp followers the peasantry of those parts of the Gangetic plain then under direct British control tribal peoples of the Himalayan foothills and Northern plains and motley others <s> By simplifying the facts the spin machine of the British Empire was able to promote the idea nearly unimpeded for well over a hundred years that it was all a matter of animal grease beef and pork tallow needed to insert rounds into Enfield rifles <s> How this single matter was supposed to have offended both Hindus and Muslims so much as to give rise to the events of a whole year in which Indian soldiers and civilians massacred British men women and children burned down their dwellings and destroyed key installations of the colonial administration is quite a mystery <s> Apparently at that time in England a popular supple- mentary explanation for the Uprising was that everybody in India was completely enraged at having to learn to behave themselves under the wonders of British rule-- much the way we are told today that <date> happened because an unspecified 'they 'were 'jealous of our freedoms ' e g see how it seemed to the Metcalfe family William Dalrymple is the first British historian to use material in translation from numerous sources written in Persian and Urdu and among the first to use the palace and city records now stored in the National Archives As a writer of popular histories he has a tough row to hoe in terms of publicizing his perceptions and findings novel and dangerous to some and not radically different enough for others <s> Still signing away on his book tour I suppose he is more inclined to discuss the hard causes of the Uprising during interviews than in this book <s> With respect to softer causes like Evangelism which he positions centrally he doesn 't indulge in overkill to make a point but sometimes confuses anger with fear and takes at face value what he could examine a bit more critically <s> Animal grease and surging Evangelism were no doubt the last straw but only because the orders to use them could not have been perceived as a simple misunderstanding after a century of many kinds of deliberate and outrageous British assaults on Indian culture property laws and human rights <s> About this a variety of Indian and foreign-born people had already reached consensus many times sometimes long before <date> <s> Those harsher provocations are not discussed in The Last Mughal which focuses on events in Delhi which was at that time still a grand and antique city in a state of preservation home to an exquisite culture <s> One hopes <smiley> is saving the tougher subject matter of how to assign responsibility for the background of the cataclysmic events of <date> for another book <s> As it is he has already told The Hindu that this book has made him more friends in India than in England <s> KASHMIRI GATE IN <date> The book is cause for celebration <s> The thinking is sensitive the language is fluid and rich <s> It conveys the excitement of breaking new ground and the pictures and line drawings at the start of each chapter are delightful <s> The two new maps parading as old ones in which Metcalfe House seems to dwarf the Imperial Palace Hindus seem to live east of the Ganges and <date> looks like the 16th century are very silly but one can 't let that get in the way <s> The British sources tend towards diaries and letters and produce an up-close-and-personal effect while the Persian and Urdu source material is more often drawn from professional writing of various kinds so it generates a more public voice and panoramic view <s> Going back and forth between the two sides of the narrative I felt as if I was walking up and down a seesaw faster and faster back and forth until the final British-led bloodbath led onto the slow grim comedy of the denouement <s> As a child I always wondered about the the strange reek inside the Mughal tombs of Delhi something like ancient bird droppings which was missing at the Taj Mahal <s> I 'd been told that these crumbly dark and elegant monuments belonged to the 16th and 17th KHOONI DARWAZA WHERE THREE SENIOR PRINCES WERE STRIPPED SHOT AND THEIR BODIES ROBBED OF JEWELRY by MAJOR WILLIAM HODSON centuries and never thought about that again <s> Now this book has brought home to me how recent was their ruin how active the scent of death and decay that hangs about them still that many of them were family mausoleums and that my great-grandfathers had already been born before a long gruesome seige and a grisly genocide was carried out in those environs in broad daylight <s> I remember the vultures were still all over Delhi more than a century later <s> <smiley> is recent article in The Guardian explores similarities between British thinking in <date> and widespread present perceptions in the West about the Iraq War <s> From some perspectives the similarities are obvious and striking from others the similarities are not fully admissible <s> It is certainly alarming to find that the mainstream press has reactivated the very same language last used by the British in <date> to describe the Uprising <math> to describe THE IRAQ WAR TODAY <s> It is disheartening to see that in the post-colonial world complications and spiraling violence can still be as easily provoked and fed upon by occupying forces playing on internecine rivalries <s> It is unpleasant to remember that the Bush Administration claimed to have received their intelligence about WMD from British sources <s> It is strange to see Queen Elizabeth who last visited Washington to bestow an award on George Bush Sr for planning and executing the first Gulf War now returning to reinforce the military alliance <s> Meanwhile Tony Blair who should probably given the current scheme of things be tried by a kangaroo court and hung up to dry is being sent off on an international farewell tour instead <s> One must wonder are her private assets not yet suitably diversified KASHMIRI GATE I appreciate and enjoy The Last Mughal for the depth and decency and richness of its narrative and will read it many times but I don 't see the point of setting out a new and elaborate defense to counter the British allegations of <date> years ago <s> The British position developed to justify deposing the monarch was that Bahadur Shah Zafar was singularly responsible for fomenting a pan-Islamic rebellion against the British stretching from West Asia across India <s> Although Sa 'am Husein might not have been plotting anything like that either to draw any similarities by implication and suggestion is to stretch facts to fit the polemic <s> The question that goes unanswered is did the British deserve it then and have we and anyone else done anything to deserve it now There is no question that the movements of <date> included Muslim jihadis as did others that came before in the multitude of violent eruptions that represented efforts to rid the Subcontinent of the British occupation <s> Surely the more important point is that these populist pan-Indian movements brought about consensus across religious and cultural lines about British wrongdoing and eventually gave birth to cooperative sustained resistance rather than belonging to or advocating for any religion <s> Today is popular resistances in West Asia carry forward a different set of historical grievances and cultural motifs although they may one day coalesce and draw a motley set of movements together so that even Sunni and Shia will come to terms <s> <smiley> either avoids or misses a key opportunity to emphasize the crossover nature of the Uprising When the sipahis call Zafar 'Prithviraj ' <smiley> offers a literal translation i e Ruler of the World <s> If this had been their intention the sipahis might have called him Shah Jehan IV <s> Zafar was more Rajput than Timurid by blood though he was also considered a Sufi pir so the the sepahis were more likely referring to the heroic and legendary 12th Century Rajput emperor Prithviraj Chauhan <repeatedchars> the last Hindu monarch to be seated at Delhi <s> But of course at 82 years of age though he might be the rightful emperor Zafar could be no Prithviraj <s> <smiley> suggests that if Zafar had led the charge to defend Delhi while the defense was on an upswing he might have reversed the course of history <s> But at that point in the book <smiley> has already established that the aged cultural and spiritual leader was far too physically feeble to do anything of the kind <s> Except the occasional nut job most European monarchs were by then pretty far distanced from being military leaders and e

can you think of any I was really challenged with coming up with 'on the spot 'project ideas where a group planners could come in and get their hands dirty right away <s> At minimum planning projects must have a strong connection to T <s> A advocacy - so that there is a high potential for change <s> That part wasn 't hard <s> What was hard was thinking about re-structuring work so that it had at-the-moment application and was highly productive <s> I stopped worrying about how it would happen and embraced the idea that what we needed could be done in many different ways <s> But that means that the hard work is really on us the organizers of Planning Corps to structure creatively any piece of work on the existing project list so that it can be done in a group at once and productively <s> If we get through this though then maybe we 'll start to see a shift in how planning can change <s> Planning Corps is new with lots of space for experimentation so if you have ideas and suggestions please do share <s> Our first meeting will be March 24 location TBD <s> People is schedules change quite a bit as job personal responsibilities shift so the hope is that the way Planning Corps works -

of <s> She started running laughing with excitement as she did so and occasionally turned around to watch the minute figures of Alan and Bunny trotting off in the opposite direction towards the deep

eight years of marriage <s> Ma had told her what to do and her belly had been full within the year <s> Fanny is child had the ability to see things others couldn 't too just like Ma <s> Ma waited for

the next thing you know you are wandering around the dell twenty years later ' 'That is about it ' Billy answered taking a final drag on his cigarette and throwing it into the fire 'He died in an accident if I remember correctly ' Lady Mabel looked across to Stanley for confirmation 'Yes he did <s> Car crash I think <s> Obviously we took a great deal of interest in that outfit after your disappearance Billy <s> We knew something had happened to you and that the answers lay with the Living <s> Never able to get to the bottom of it mind you <s> The conclusion was that you had gone

splayed out on his belly and wagged his tail <s> Billy smiled despite himself 'What is up with you Eh soft la 'd he said unable to resist bending down and making another fuss of it <s> The old woman had turned around and was catching up the distance between them <s> Billy noticed a dejected air about her and sighed <s> Grabbing a large amount of his own prized firewood he ran over to her the dog

was pointing and squinting through the sunshine and peered closely at the very boring tree situated in the tiny garden beyond the graveyard they were standing in <s> Elizabeth no 'ed <s> My dad

<s> because you can never have too much yarn porn january 1 i started a <date> photo-a-day project and in consultation with many of your good selves i created a flickr group to support it and for us to have a place to share our photos and give feedback to one another with the idea of improving our photography in the initial heady days of january it was so much fun it seemed like the year would fly by and the inspiration would continue to flow like a fountain all these people who knew one another from the blogosphere and a few new ones joined in and we became friends and everyone learned and made explore and was happy then february struck most of those in the group live in the northern hemisphere so it was the darkest coldest most dreary part of the winter and it was hard now it is march and spring is taking its sweet time in coming at least where i live there are days when i look outside at the aging snowbanks and the bare trees and i think 'i can 't possibly take a picture of anything worthwhile today 'but then i take a wander around the house or i look at the photos the others in the group have taken and i feel inspired by something someone else photographed and i get through it because i promised myself i would and my promises to myself have to mean something and you reach a point where you keep doing it BECAUSE it is hard and because doing things that are hard can be good for you and because it makes you buy fresh flowers on a regular basis my reasons for doing this have already changed in the 75 days it is been running at the beginning if i am honest i wanted to show off my ability to take breathtaking pictures and develop more consistency in that now i realize that such a project is more about documenting what is going on in my life and i admit that it is most decidedly not breathtaking on a daily basis some days i use my <weirdcaps> thank goodness i 've got hipstamatic and camerabag and other apps to make that more interesting when the weather gets good i am going to use some of my film cameras they 're best at outdoor photos i realized that a profound macro of the inside of my cat is ear doesn 't actually help me document my life on a daily basis so i 've worked at pushing myself away from those and towards things that will help me remember what was going on and what was important to me at a particular moment in time i think ultimately i 'll find that this project is about memory for me the other reason i did this was to be more mindful of the world around me to notice things to see differently last year at about this time i got on a total eyeball kick which i later realized was about my wanting to SEE differently having to take a photo every day makes me look differently at the world i 'll admit it is hard for me not to see the current e <kikoo> dus from the group as a personal rejection of sorts despite endless explanations to the contrary but i am trying and until i can forget about it that is all i can do in the meantime it makes me quite sad to see people give up and leave us whatever their reasons but although i 'll admit it shakes my conviction especially because it is people i love and respect i remain committed after all i read recently about a guy who took a picture every single day from <date> 'til his death in <date> now THAT is commitment if you 're not now totally put off the idea of taking a photo every day and you 'd like to join us please check out the blog camp <date> group on flickr it is never too late to start - - - and the picture at the top what does it have to do with all of this well it was one of THOSE days where i took what felt like <date> pictures of the new yarn that i am going to use to make granny squares after kristina and ulrika teach me this coming weekend and i wasn 't pleased with how any of them turned out but then i played with them in lightroom and i think this one came out ok a process that was good for me and which framboesa talks about very thoughtfully here yesterday in the flickr group kristine had a shot of her passport and used it to tell the story of how she was soon moving on to her next assignment i didn 't have any idea what i was going to do for my photo so i did one of those tribute shots as they 're called when you blatantly copy what someone did and give them credit i located my old passport and my current one and as can often be the case with these daily photos took a little trip down memory lane old on the left current on the right my passports are fatter than your usual passport and that is because both of them have had pages a 'ed to them twice you 'll also notice that my old passport was green it was my first one and i didn 't know that most americans have a blue one i was 'lucky 'and got the green one during a very small window when they issued ben franklin commemorative passports it is actually thanks to benjamin franklin that we all have passports at all as it was his idea the unusual green passport caused me no end of grief when i was traveling a lot in the balkans in the late 90s border guards constantly questioned its authenticity and one guard at the turkish-greek border actually sai 'dgreen passport very bad very ba 'dand made a slicing motion across his neck i was quite alarmed but the conversation stopped there as that was apparently the extent of his english and my turkish was nonexistent i 've survived to tell the tale so i guess it wasn 't really very bad and i never did ever meet anyone else with a green one as an american you get stamped everywhere you go and you often need visas the first passport filled up because the macedonian visa took a whole page every time and i had to have a new one if i popped down to thessaloniki for a weekend or up to belgrade for a coffee it was early days after macedonia found themselves rather to their surprise with their own country and it took them awhile to realize they could issue multiple-entry visas i eventually got one of those but not before they had used up ten pages of my passport a number of countries - china and india come to mind - think nothing of taking up an entire page of your passport for the visa and the visas are elaborately colorful and often feature shiny holograms i guess they want you to feel you got your money is worth on the bright side they 're usually good for a least six months so you don 't need a new one should you be sent those places again i did use up two whole pages on indian visas as i had to go there frequently enough that one expired and i needed another audible sigh the bulk of my travel occurred during the bush administration and i clearly remember standing in lines at passport control concealing my passport as i felt a little sheepish about being american during those years i happened to be in the philippines when obama was elected and i very clearly remember the sense of relief tho ' bush was still president when i realized that i no longer had to hide my passport while i stood in line on that occasion people in line saw it and several actually smiled and gave me a thumbs up with the incomprehensible debacle of health care reform who would seriously not want to limit the influence of insurance companies on their personal health going on in the <smiley> right now i am not sure i wouldn 't actually begin to conceal my passport again if i were queuing today many of the pages are covered in stamps that say 'k¯benhavn 'because i get stamped every time i come back into the country if it is not from scandinavia or the schengen countries it tapered off because eventually i knew all of the guys at passport control and convinced them to not to stamp me every time i 've loved the travel opportunities i 've had through my various jobs the job i am starting in april will not have so many travel opportunities but i 've been thinking about it and i am really ok with that looking at all of these stamps exhausts me a little bit when i see the dates for the convoluted trip i took from copenhagen to singapore to heathrow to gatwick to budapest to constanza and back to copenhagen in one crazy week it makes me tired i hope companies today are using the possibilities afforded by electronic meeting software rather than sending someone to give a 30 minute presentation in singapore on monday and the same one in romania on wednesday i remember thinking it was all very exciting at the time tho ' having to switch from heathrow to gatwick was madness and an example of how bad the travel agent was but today i wouldn 't even want to do it and i would probably have the good sense to say no but in those days sounds like long ago but it is not even three years ago i actually quite liked it and of course felt i had to do all of the things that were asked of me these stamps document for me how far i 've come not just literally but metaphorically as well i think i 've learned to say no to such madness today and i hope that one good thing to come out of economic crisis is that employees aren 't asked to do trips like that these days because companies think twice before spending 40 <date> 7 <date> kroner on such a ticket i am going to lose my gold status on both SAS and KLM here in the next couple of months and tho ' there was a time not so long ago when that would have panicked me i am resting quite easily in the knowledge the world is changing and times are changing and it is no longer environmentally defensible to pop over to london for lunch or take a private plane back from newcastle like we did in the mid-noughties i loved those times and am grateful for all the places i 've been but i am quite ready to stay a bit closer to home for awhile and besides taking the train down through europe is quite romantic i miss being in an academic environment i miss the thrill of reading a really dense sentence and pulling meaning out of it that applies the world around me i think it is why i used quotes from susan sontag is on photography on my <date> project photos during february husband looks like an entirely new person in his new glasses must photograph him soon but is it the glasses or his new job or our impending move giving him that glow maybe it is all of it i learned that our new little samsung U10 HD flashcam can 't really handle filming in the dimly-lit riding hall note the flashcam doesn 't violate the 'not buying things in <date> 'because i actually bought it back in december but my sister only just sent it last week cleaning out the attic is like visiting a flea market and finding all kinds of treasures only without spending any money who knew we had all this cool stuff if you trip over a sweet little brass deer in the yard at a house you 're contemplating it is a sign right and if you accidentally take that little deer with you it is not really stealing right since it was abandoned out in the yard at a house that stands empty one drawback of sunshine it exposes just how much your windows need cleaning stieg larsson is sweden is answer to dan brown only we won 't be subjected to more of his hack writing since he died but i 'll admit that i like the characters of mikael blomqvist and lisbeth salander so i re read on sometimes you just have to read trash but arthur koestler is the ghost in the machine is next on my nightstand so i shall redeem myself every day after husband and sabin leave i think that i 'll go back to bed but i never do and soon i won 't be able to since i 'll be headed off for work in an actual office myself sometimes i wonder if others can hear that ringing in my ears i packed marxism and theology books in the same box this weekend and wondered aloud if i would be going to hell for that tho ' thankfully i cannot since i don 't believe in hell and it is like santa claus if you don 't believe it in it doesn 't believe in you thanks gwen <smiley> husband is response 'god is more of a marxist than you think 'and the more we discussed it the more i think he is right there is something of the new testament over the communist manifesto i wish i 'd written my dissertation on that of course i still could since i haven 't actually written it yet i tucked all those little end bits of yarn into my scarf last night while watching hercule poirot who is so gay by the way not that there is anything wrong with that it was much easier than i thought it would be now i hope i can figure out how to join the ends together when the time comes to do that i really wish i was on my way to the bookstore with trinsch this morning she is going to browse books on new media and then she gets to write about it i am so envious it leaves me positively longing for academia i do love these little random thought downloads they just completely clear my head and leave me feeling ready to face the week pondering happiness quite a lot in the face of the excitement of moving to the other side of the country which admittedly is like moving from one side of wisconsin to the other and not as big as it might sound husband is like a little kid anticipating christmas he actually fell asleep last night with a smile on his face he is covering reams of paper with sketches of the possibilities for renovations we 're now betting on two horses as it were and have given an offer on a second place since the dog sled transport to northern canada is apparently unreliable or else the laid back realtor hasn 't actually sent a dog sled or any thing else as we 've heard nothing regarding our first offer not being ones to wait around husband has now talked himself and thereby both of us into the second place being better anyway and he is right there are more possibilities for ripping out everything that is there and putting it back in as we would want it now betting on this one as well what is cool is that there is a lake on the property and although the first thing it needs is a new roof that does afford opportunities not afforded by the other place which recently had a new roof although the engineering calculations surrounding that new roof are openly suspect in several places so i think husband is right the second property is better for us anyway but my point actually is that even just talking about all of this is making us so happy leading me to think about what happiness is it is an eternal question isn 't it and we 're eternally in search of happiness tho ' i am not sure we always recognize it when we see it for me it is something different than contentment contentment is a mild tame form of happiness a resting easy thing whereas what i think makes us happy makes us really tick is having some enormous seemingly impossible daunting project on the horizon i can definitely see that in husband he is transformed and positively beaming at the prospect of this project of course it is also his new job that is transformed him - he was more than a little bored and frustrated at work and just going through the motions he is looking forward to his new job but even more to the new house and all of the possibilities it represents these projects also remind me of our strengths - i can see things in my mind and he can build them i pick colors he paints them in other words i get all the fun and he does all the work i guess i 'll probably spend another summer with no kitchen cooking on an old stove out in the yard and eating lots of salads maybe it 'll be time to try that raw diet i 've long wanted to try perhaps it will clear my mind so that i 'll make good choices on all of those colors that we 'll need on the walls in the new house whichever one it ends up being at least the waiting paralysis of last week seems to have passed and an excited expectant happiness has stepped in to replace it and that makes me very happy what made you happy this weekend march 7 march 9 march 11 march 13 i am especially pleased with that row of yellow it is some yarn i bought last summer at the viking fair in roskilde it is hand-dyed with natural plant dyes - gyldenris as it is called in danish not sure what that is in english the colors are slightly less vibrant than this in real life i 've got the saturation dialed up a notch or two in my camera at the moment i should have bought the entire basket of this yarn dyed with natural plant dyes - - - a big congratulations to molly my very first

mind wanders off to that dog sled that should have reached that guy you want to buy the house from wherever he is in the northern reaches of canada you talked to the realtor yesterday but he was as laid back as his accent and not at all worried that the guy hadn 't answered yet you asked in a slightly hysterical voice if they had in fact really sent a dog sled he pretends he knows what you 're talking about and laughs it seems that your new job will start a whole lot sooner than you thought which is both good and bad because you haven 't used your time all that wisely and now su 'enly you won 't have any but on the other hand it will undoubtedly be good for you to dress in normal clothes fix your hair and put on makeup and go out among people on a daily basis your photo-a-day project may suffer and focus rather too frequently on the wind turbine just outside your new office window but time will tell time will tell on all of it and time takes its sweet time so strange how it can both crawl at a snail is pace and race by in the same instant but time is mysterious that way and life is full of contradictions 
<s> Fifteen years ago I was on my way to the Austin airport to catch a flight to New York City when the friend I 'd be staying with called and said that we 'd be attending a dance performance that evening in the East Village <s> Admission was free she said but the organizers requested a donation of two canned goods for a food pantry <s> So before walking out the door I grabbed a couple of Ranch Style Beans as my offering <s> Ranch Style Beans are a Texan staple and they 've been satisfying people since <date> with their take on classic chuck-wagon fare <s> It is a distinctive flavor the beans aren 't fiery but they do have a depth and brightness that can be very a 'ictive <s> When I lived in Texas we ate them often either topped with cheese and rice as a base to bean salad alongside enchiladas or even in my mom is King Ranch casserole <s> But beyond the deliciousness and versatility of Ranch Style Beans there is the appeal of that iconic black can with its distinctive

believe it <s> In the 15 years since I 've moved to New York City I 've seen this city become more hospitable to fellow homesick Texans <s> We now have a Texan-style barbecue joint selling Kreuz sausages and excellent brisket you can find Ro-Tel tomatoes at several grocery stores dried and canned chiles are a common staple and Austin-based Whole Foods is now here selling decent brands of tortillas chips and salsas <s> But despite the advances this city is made there is still one thing missing my beloved Ranch Style Beans <s> To help with the drought every time I go home I load up on a few cans <s> And my mom has even been known to put them in my Christmas stocking which is always a very welcome gift <s> But when I recently came to my last can with no trip home in my immediate

that Ranch Style Beans are simply pintos swimming in a chili gravy <s> At last it all made sense I decided I 'd cook a pot of pintos in a chili gravy and see what happened <s> When making my chile gravy I used the ingredient list on the back of my remaining can as my guide <s> Sure there were some vague terms such as ispices ' and 'natural flavor ' but the basic building blocks were in the open tomatoes chile peppers paprika vinager and beef fat <s> And of course pinto beans <s> Even though the can didn 't specify what type of chile I went with anchos as they 're the base of your common chili powder <s> I rehydrated the anchos and then blended them with some tomatoes vinegar cumin and paprika <s> And instead of beef fat I opted to use beef broth instead <s> While the beans cooked the house smelled gorgeous and the broth tasted right <s> But it wasn 't until after a few hours when I ladled out a bowl that I realized that this bowl of beans far exceeded my expectations <s> I threw in some sour cream warmed up a flour tortilla and had a most satisfying meal <s> And even though it is been 15 years since I gave away those beans I 've often wondered if the New Yorker who ended up

recommended I set up a Homesick Texan fan page so I did <s> Please stop by and feel free to share links upload photos or just say howdy Homesick Texan fan page If you were in Houston in the <date> is it was hard to escape the ubiquitous tacos al carbon <s> Ninfa Laurenzo of the eponymous Ninfa is made them her signature dish and as with her green sauce many Houston Mexican restaurants soon a 'ed these tacos to their menus as well <s> Tacos al carbon became a defining characteristic of Houston Tex-Mex But what exactly are tacos al carbon The term al carbon is the Spanish phrase for cooking over coal so you should expect grilled meats inside a tortilla <s> If you have tacos al carbon in Mexico you will indeed find a variety of meats wrapped in either corn or flour tortillas depending on where you are geographically <s> But in Texas tacos al carbon came to mean one thing cuts of grilled beef nestled in a fluffy flour tortilla <s> But wait isn 't that a fajita Now this is where it gets confusing <s> So what is the difference between fajitas and tacos al carbon As I understand it very little <s> Fajitas which translates to little belts are traditionally made with the tough diaphragm cut of beef known as skirt steak which is a long and narrow much like a belt <s> The meat is often marinated and then grilled or gri 'led and it is served with a prescribed array of condiments such as guacamole pico de gallo sour cream and a stack of flour tortillas all used to roll your own tacos <s> And yes you can make fajitas the dish out of shrimp or chicken but since the word itself refers to the cut of beef technically it should be called something else <s> Tacos al carbon however can be made with any type of meat not just the traditional skirt steak <s> And unlike fajitas the tacos are already made instead of being a do-it-yourself affair <s> I think this is the main difference but even for me it is a bit of a semantic stretch <s> Small differences aside I still prefer tacos al carbon to fajitas <s> Sure fajitas are a quite the spectacle but sometimes you crave a more refined presentation Or perhaps I prefer tacos al carbon because I burned myself on the sizzling fajita skillet one too many times But no matter how you serve it it is hard to resist a fresh flour tortilla wrapped around succulent beef so flavorful you can eat the two together unadorned <s> I live in a small apartment without any outdoor space so there is no cooking over coal for me <s> But if I get my cast-iron skillet hot enough and then slide my steak under the broiler I get a nice charred crust that is almost as good as what I could get on a grill <s> So yes technically these aren 't true tacos al carbon they 're more like tacos a la plancha which means tacos of the gri 'le <s> But I don 't mind because after one bite I am back in that little restaurant on Navigation where the beef is juicy the tortillas are soft and the green sauce is plentiful <s> Tacos al carbon small-apartment style

and let it marinate for 2 to 8 hours in the refrigerator <s> Before cooking rinse off the marinade and let the steak come to room temperature <s> Heat on high for 10 minutes a large cast-iron skillet

dish but because of its richness I only advise serving it on special occasions <s> When it comes to a more everyday simple macaroni and cheese I turn to a method I learned in the New York Times <s> This recipe requires little effort besides pouring cottage cheese blended with milk over dry pasta tossing in some shre 'ed cheese and baking it for an hour <s> No endless stirring a sauce or boiling a batch of pasta which makes it a cinch to make <s> The Times version kept it plain but I 've made it my own by a 'ing chipotle and garlic <s> And I top it with bacon and cotija which a is contrast to

<s> Curious why they were known as Mexican pancakes he admitted that there was nothing authentically Mexican about them but it was very very important to be listening to Tejano music preferably loud

hand however so I went to the Union Square farmers ' market to pick up a tub <s> But a snowstorm had threatened to blanket the city and my preferred lard vendor wasn 't there clearly I had to come up with another plan <s> I 've been spending lots of time lately reading old cookbooks <s> I am curious to see what our ancestors ate and to see when certain dishes may have come into the common culinary vernacular <s> When looking for inspiration I recalled that I had recently come across an old Mexican-candy recipe that called for piloncillo or brown sugar to be cooked with water and a strip of raw bacon <s> Now I know bacon in a dessert is a trendy thing these days but I was intrigued to see it listed in a <date> year-old recipe <s> And while I didn 't have lard to make cookies bacon was easily attainable <s> In another cookbook I had seen a recipe for Mexican-chocolate pralines <s> So for the pork-themed feast I decided to combine the two thoughts and make Mexican-chocolate pralines with bacon <s> Making a first-time dish to share at a large gathering is always brave if not foolish <s> And while the flavor of these pralines was pleasing the texture was too delicate <s> So instead of patties thick with pecans and bacon I had broken chips and shards instead <s> My pralines looked sad <s> Plus you couldn 't even really taste the bacon But I was out of time and couldn 't show up empty handed so I threw the pieces into a tin and headed to the party <s> I suppose my offering these praline pieces was the equivalent of a student who shows a failed project to a teacher to prove that she has at least tried to complete the assignment <s> I gave myself about a C for effort <s> But then a strange thing happened <s> While at the party I witnessed people eating the Mexican-chocolate praline pieces <s> And they were smiling With pleasure So with a little work I knew I could make the Mexican chocolate pralines into something special <s> Buoyed by my friends ' comments the next day I attempted to make these pralines again <s> I threw out the bacon even though it had been the primary impetus to make these in the first place a 'ed more nuts let the candy cook longer and threw in some orange zest for a hint of brightness <s> And after an hour of letting the pralines harden I had a long sheet of parchment paper lined with a fine batch of Mexican chocolate pralines <s> If you 're looking for Valentine is inspiration these take little time and effort to make but are very impressive even when they 're not entirely perfect <s> But you don 't need a special

just part of mountain biking <s> But I could feel the disparity in my quad muscle strength as I attempted the climb <s> It is a little bit of a bummer but I know it will get better <s> It messed with my head for the rest of the ride though <s> We went on a new singletrack trail that was built with Keith is help while I was away Ticketron <s> Normally it would 've been no problem <s> Okay maybe I would have popped off the bike in a couple of places <s> Instead I walked a lot of it with my bike <s> The steep climb out of Deer Canyon usually called for some hike-a-biking but I was doin ' way more hikin ' than bikin ' <s> When we arrived at the first stretch of single track on Fenceline it was no problem but the second stretch I had to clip out so quickly and so often that I gave up and

mentioned that I really liked the Hammer Gel Apple Cinnamon flavor <s> I said 'Wow this tastes just like apple pie ' Dan replied right back 'Oh I 'd need ice cream with that ' Which pretty much gives you the flavor of the conversation that went back and forth between three immature trail patrol volunteers <s> When we arrived back in the parking lot we had a visit from <date> is Dad who rode across a couple of mountain ranges to meet up with us and say 'Hi ' What a guy Next week I get to do it all over again <s> <repeatedchars> maybe I 'll take a different route <s> Would you believe Slow n Easy

<s> I 've been thinking lately about what it is that draws a woman to a man and vice-versa And is there really such a thing as love at first sight <punctuationfreak> I know for myself there are certain things that immediately draw me in and I am talking pure aesthetics a great smile nice teeth engaging eyes good skin nice hands to name a few <s> But love <punctuationfreak> What is it beyond that immediate attraction that makes someone take a second and a third and a fourth look People often say that they know within the first 5 minutes whether someone they 've met has boyfriend girlfriend 'potential 'or not <s> I think what is more often the case is that you know instantly if someone doesn 't have a chance but not necessarily if they do <s> Personality is such a HUGE X-factor and it is truly such a variable that I think it is almost impossible to completely rule someone out without having a conversation <s> And what is an appealing character trait in one person doesn 't necessarily carry the same appeal on another <s> Weird how that is but when people overlook the fact that someone is rude thoughtless selfish unkind or disrespectful just to be with the bombshell or the handsome hunk we know how long those relationships last - not very There are certain deal breakers however <s> Instant No-Can-Dos <s> Shorter than me Nope <s> Unintelligent I 'll pass <s> Smoke cigarettes Hell to the no Now while I don 't think I 've ever experienced love at first sight I think I 've had lust lol but I would never rule out the fact that i 
<s> I don 't remember the last time I had visited a grave on the Mt of Olives <s> Yes I 'd been to Ibrahim is home but he lives in the neighborhood of the living I guess I don 't know that many holy people The Mt of Olives is the world is oldest and holiest Jewish cemetery dating from biblical times Many holy rabbis over the centuries have been buried there Even Madonna visited one of the Kabbalah rabbis when she was here with the Kabbalah center This past Friday however was the anniversary of my friend is son is death 5 years ago He had a rare genetic thing which left him since birth severely handicapped He never walked or spoke When he died at the age of 14 he was buried in the Mt of Olives in a special plot for holy children - those who never spoke bad about anyone It is a special merit to be buried there because space is limited and is usually reserved for renowned rabbis these days Legend has it that when the resurrection happens people buried there will be resurrected first <s> It was tough on my friend to visit his grave She lost a son It is always tough for the living She knows he is fine not trapped in a very handicapped body When she dreams about him he even speaks to her - something he never did when he was alive I looked around at the gravestones Some were so tiny - the babies must have been a few days weeks or months when they died Someone pointed out that right behind my friend is son is grave were the graves of the two Holzberg children - the children of the Chassidic couple that was killed during the Mumbai massacre a couple of years ago by Islamic extremists They had died of illness before the tragedy with their parents occurred Now they have no parents visiting their graves - only a 4 year old brother and grandparents After we read the psalms and the quorum of 10 men left the mother and a few of her friends stayed on to sit and keep this young soul of her son some company We listened to the mother grieve for her son for her loneliness and some shared what they felt too grieving for a loved one I felt serene and there was an atmosphere of contentment sitting around the little souls tiny grave There were red poppies growing wild by unmarked graves I looked at the Holzberg graves and told my friend that her son and this boy were now friends and learning chassidut together Cellphones are expensive but so necessary I wonder how we managed years ago when we had to depend on pay phones to tell someone we 'll be late or make impulsive last minute arrangements with friends and relatives How inconvenient it all was trying to find that quarter or whatever the cost was then But my cellphone bill has been expensive of late and so I called up the competitor of my current cell provider There are three major cellphone companies in Israel Cellcom Pelephone and Orange I got a much better offer from the competitor after complaining about my current cellphone provider so after a week or so I got on the phone with my current provider and told them about the offer <s> Can they match it Closely They connected me with a special department called Customer Retention or something like that I would get a new phone at <math> of the cost I complained that their competitor offered me a free one OK - then they 'll give me a free one too Wow It sounded so easy I went to their service store and waited nearly an hour to be seated with one of their reps They wrote my number down on a piece of paper <s> I was number <date> Number <date> flashed on the screen but there was no customer They probably got impatient and left I could have been crafty and written the number <date> on the other side of the paper to be promptly seated - but I am too American Or Canadian I 'll wait my turn the way civilized people are apt to do I finally got my turn The sales rep gets my phone number and asks me questions 'How much did they offer you 'I asked - 'Isn 't it on the computer 'Yes but you 're a special case from the retention department What exactly did they promise you ' I told him 'Yes you 're right 'he says - obviously regaining his eyesight as what they promised was probably on the computer screen all along I couldn 't figure out why they were playing this game <s> About 5 minutes into this a woman comes over to me with a typed up survey in her hand - asking me how the service is and how is the sales rep I am talking to 'Isn 't it o ' that you 're asking me how is he when I am right in front of him 'Give me a 10 isaid the sales rep to me 'Ok I 'll give you a 10 but if I find that you 're saying 'ok ' to whatever was agreed on the phone and I get a totally different more expensive bill I am coming back to rate you a 1 'Don 't worry The new rate will show up on your bill 'The new rate didn 't show up on what I signed and after I questioned him he said it was standard I 'll get the new rate on my next bill because I was a ispecial 'case 'So in case you 're lying to me how long am I contracted to you '18 months 'Fine That is better than the more common 3 year contract If they 're a bunch of liars I 'll use my phone minimally and pay the minimum charge and after 18 months switch to another provider For years ever since we made aliyah I was considered by my kids to be so uncool After all I am an immigrant speak Hebrew with an embarrassing accent plus my grammar is often wrong I like Western music Arabs Arabic music health food go to a trippy synagogue in Jerusalem invite non-Jews for Shabbat dinner eat in different restaurants all the time see foreign films and often go alone My oldest daughter even bought me a birthday gift - a <math> movie package - at Jerusalem is landmark Smadar theater I love the Smadar They didn 't destroy the Ottomon-era terracotta stone floors and opened up a restaurant attached to the theater Unlike the cinemateque you can bring in your beer and cappucino or hot cider - even wine - into the theater There are others like me who sit alone in the theater Lately I saw the movies Push and A Serious Man there Next week I am seeing a Korean film with a friend But now all of a su 'en I am cool My complainer daughter hardly complains anymore She hugs and kisses me daily The reason She has a new boyfriend This guy comes from a Moroccan family BUT and here is a big BUT he enjoys Ashkenazi European Western culture more than his own <s> He doesn 't listen to Mi 'le Eastern music and is astounded that my daughter acts more 'Moroccan 'than he It is something he has to get used to he says His brother is actually a famous Israeli singer who still churns out Israeli hits This new boyfriend loves the Beatles Doors Stones and Fats Domino My daughter doesn 't know the songs to any of these But now she is coming to me to learn this new Western culture her boyfriend is into She is now proud of her once-uncool mother I know I am going to have to bring that photo of Ronnie Wood of the Rolling Stones and me together at an art gallery out of basement storage to impress him 'You 're gonna love my mother ishe coos to her boyfriend 'you might even want to marry her ' she jokes perhaps knowing a little of my Cougar fantasies 'See This is how it starts First you eat like that and then you start inviting Arabs into the house 'griped my son-in-law as I gave my daughter his wife some healing foods for her ulcerative colitis Brown rice with broccoli and carrots drizzled with flax seed oil I was amused by his theory wondering if it were indeed true <s> He shook his head He truly believes that granola eating hippies like his mother-in-law weren 't always loving and tolerant human beings but turned that way when they eschewed mostly junk food for a healthier lifestyle His wife was eating crap like diet soda and fast food nearly every day and the result is ulcerative colitis which I am trying to help her heal through food And if that will heal her body as well as her soul then why not Because she 'll turn into me Is that what he is afraid of I laughed at the prospect of her turning into a peace-nik and inviting all the Arabs who live in Jabel Mukaber into their tiny West Jerusalem home and him another mi 'le-east Archie Bunker tearing his hair out <s> My son is school has been calling me all month trying to get me to come to another one of their 'emergency ameetings about my son who shows up in school but hardly in class 'There are teachers who don 't even know who he is 'exclaimed his principal <s> I tell the principal is secretary that I can 't make it on the Sunday she wants me to come because my boss has a slew of meetings that day and I have to prepare her on that day 'Isn 't your son important to you Don 't you even care Is your job so much more important than your own son We made this meeting with a lot of people involved and that is when they could come <punctuationfreak> ' The principal is secretary is actually screaming at me I look at the phone I am totally pissed She continues 'they want to throw him out of school Don 't you think that is important 'I glare into the phone Unfortunately she can 't see me gritting my teeth 'You never asked ME when 'I 'can make it Keeping my job is showing my kids how responsible I am If I don 't have my job then we 'll be living in the streets I am not ready to sacrifice my job for a meeting in school Sorry 'I think she was shocked by my response There was silence on the other end of the line <s> I continued 'If you want to throw him out of school it will just have to wait another week 'I shouted back at the secretary I made the appointment for the week after when my boss will be out of town <s> That afternoon I went into the local mall where one of the shops was selling pillows My kids were all sleeping on pillows that had seen better days But that day I was only buying for one of them I ask her to show me a selection for my 20 year old daughter The shopkeeper shows me a latex pillow that is the most expensive one in the store 'It is quite a lot of money 'I complained to her 'I 'd like to buy her a mid-range one Not the cheapest and not the most expensive 'She looked at me funny 'But it is your daughter <punctuationfreak> Isn 't she worth the best 'I looked at the shopkeeper funny 'Absolutely not 'And then I walked out of the store seeing the shopkeeper is mouth still open here in the Holy Land we are basking in the sun I usually don 't like to make you people living with cold weather jealous but today I 'll make an exception <s> We ate at Bariba overlooking the Yarkon River and Reading plant Mullet fish over risotto in saffron sauce The best mushroom gnocchi I 've ever tasted covered with Parmesean foam All sorts of people passed by That dog wants ice cream some people went boating some kids went swimming The Farmers Market was in full swing one of Hubby is favorite stores on Dizengoff Street with the latest fashion in undies if you can call them that Road signs wishing travellers a Shabbat Shalom I prepared so well I thought for the upcoming ticket sales in Israel for the Elton John concert in June I read the reports of groups trying to get him to boycott Israel Yawn This is getting boring already They do this to every celebrity who books concerts here Most ignore the boycott pleas and threats I hope Elton has the balls to pay no heed to these party poopers Cancelling a concert will not make things better for Palestinians in this country It 'll just piss me off and probably a few other peacemakers too But getting back to the tickets <s> Advance ticket sales were available to Bank Discount members beginning from 7 00 pm last night I am a member or rather my husband is - even though that bank pisses me off - except when they give their members perks such as this I called up the bank last week to make sure that my credit card was open and ok to accept purchases After all it has been over a year since I used it The bank clerk told me that there is no problem with the card Yesterday I called another bank clerk to get more credit in case I want to buy more than 4 tickets He said everything is fine Wonderful I am ready <s> I did some errands then came back to the office at 6 45 pm and got the website ready on my computer Of course by the time 7 00 pm rolled around it took me 20 minutes to get onto the site I finally got in Yay I filled out all the information they needed picked out some fabulous seats in the front row on the side of the stage - very close to the stage in fact - and then took my credit card out I plugged in the numbers my ID number etc and then I saw the expiry date I look at the card - remember I had been planning this for a week already - and the expiry date says <date> SHIT I tried putting in a random expiry date but the computer is smart It doesn 't take my card I use the other Visa I have but the computer insists I use the Bank Discount credit card I leave the webpage open just in case I never get in again because of all the people trying to buy tickets at the same time I have to think fast I call up the credit card company I am frantic I am wondering if there are more frantic people calling them about Elton John 'Look I am trying to buy Elton John tickets and my visa date expired Can you give me a new updated date Please 'It seems hopeful at first while the clerk puts me on hold probably to speak to his manager He comes back on 'Sorry <s> You have to speak to your bank about this We don 't give new expiry dates 'But my bank doesn 't open until 8 30 in the morning 'I wailed 'Can 't you give me a temporary one 'No I am so sorry ' He really sounded sympathetic But there was no point in arguing with him I had to think quickly while the ticket sales website was still on the payment page AH I remembered that a good friend of mine has a Discount Visa We tried doing this together but she had a difficult time with the Hebrew instructions I guided her through but the transaction failed She doesn 't have enough credit on her card <s> Never give up My Complainer daughter has to do something good for her mother doesn 't she instead of chronically complaining all the time I call her several times She doesn 't answer her phone It is 8 00 pm and no tickets I go out for dinner with friends My daughter calls and apologizes <s> She was working and couldn 't answer her phone but if I am in town we can go home together <s> Yes and I could take your Visa I thought She didn 't complain when I asked her for it Not a flinch When I arrived home after midnight I went into my son is room where the computer is I let him rant and rave about me making noise I tried to bribe him with concert tickets but he is not interested I finally get into the site Most of the great seats are gone - except for the very expensive lawn seats I get a gate close to the stage but 23 rows up Not bad Not as great as I could have gotten had I had an updated credit card but they were good nevertheless <s> So Elton hang on it 'll be a rocky road with every asshole trying to get you to cancel the concert Don 't listen to anyone Just do what you have to do so we can all have a great time together <s> Be careful who you start conversations with standing at bus stops It is not like people are dangerous here They aren 't And it is easy to jump into a stranger is conversation The stranger who is talking usually looks around and talks to whoever is standing around Some are receptive and sometimes one can engage in fun conversation about all sorts of things while waiting for the bus <s> So yesterday I jumped into a bus stop conversation about People Persian people and then Russian people 'Not all of them are bad isaid a woman to a man 'You always get one bad apple in the tree 'the man answered <s> I interjected in Hebrew 'Well what do you think about Canadians 'Bad move on my part The man continued his tirade all throughout the 40 minute bus ride with me about his Canadian neighbor whose dog barked outside every day at 4 00 am 'I told her I was going to kill the dog ' He leered at me He clearly isn 't too fond of Canadians Then he went on about putting talcum powder on the floor and I couldn 't understand half of what he was saying I really just wanted to relax on the bus ride home and not talk to anyone I got home and tried to make dinner The two men in the family began bickering 'Who ate my cookies 'demanded Hubby Someone at work made chocolate chip cookies for me for my birthday I brought them home and told Hubby that they were for him for HIS birthday this week He was so happy Before the cookies were eaten that is My son admitted to the crime 'There were only 10 left '10 <punctuationfreak> YOU ATE ALL 10 <punctuationfreak> YOU PIG <punctuationfreak> 'and a war of the words started with name calling back and forth which ended up with my son throwing Hubby is files out of our son is room where they are kept and then Hubby taking the computer monitor out of our son is room and putting it into our locked storage room <s> And then I thought it is much easier dealing with strangers on the bus who can talk the ass out of a turkey than this <s> It was bad enough when the water stopped running right before the Sabbath I was about to put on the slow cooker a dish called Hamin which takes overnight to cook and consists of everything basically - meat chicken beans potatoes stuffing barley and seasoned either sweet or salty or mi 'le eastern The water shut off just as I was about to wash a bunch of scallions I was horrified I ended up washing the scallions in a pot full of water that had cooked the artichokes I felt good I was recycling The neighbors kept on going onto the roof to see if they could fix the water thing whatever it is called while the rain was pouring down at the same time For a few minutes they were successful and then <math> no water from the taps Again We thought of a weekend with toilets full of shit and family members in sore need of a shower 'I have my PERIOD <punctuationfreak> ishouted one of my daughters during the meal 'What is a period 'asked my bright 18 year old son He had no idea what that word meant in English 'YOU tell him 'I ordered my son-in-law <s> But before our meal while this water shortage thing was going on I had smelled smoke coming from the air vents I panicked because Hubby was over at my married daughter is house in Jerusalem and called the fire department Two men came into the house looking like professional ghostbusters or whatever Oxygen tanks on their backs contraptions which measure or find the source of the smoke The odor was quite strong They were with me in the apartment for a good 20 minutes Then I lift up one of my pots that was on the stove and see a little rattan coaster sticking to the bottom of the pot It was burnt to a crisp I found the culprit and I felt so stupid The firemen looked at me and smiled They must go through this often I thought perhaps others would be as mindless as myself <s> Meanwhile Hubby returned as the men were leaving He didn 't care if the house was burning - he was just thrilled to be able to eat on paper plates as his dishwashing duties was temporarily suspended 
<s> the Novelista Barista today featured me in her blog <s> I am extremely flattered by what she had to say <s> Take a look A 'catch-up ' post is on the way probably tomorrow watch this space x When I am in Malta I generally avoid shopping like the plague <s> Not only are most prices higher the Euro isn 't exactly in my favour either <s> But last time I was there I was determined to get my hands on the new Chasing Pandora CD The Driver and the Dancer <s> And ever since then I haven 't really been able to turn it off <s> The Distance Between <smiley> is one of my very favourite songs off the album although I love them all which I cannot often say about an album <s> Unfortunately I haven 't been able to find the video online but the entire CD can be heard free on their website musically 
<s> A 'ed in a couple of items to the Tiny Lifestyle Changes today <s> One I 've been doing for a while and it is working well for me <s> The other is a suggestion made by my associate rector Matt and it is the kind of thing that would work for me if I did it regularly so I am going to make the attempt to do that too <s> The one that I am already doing is from my pastoral counselor <s> He suggested that to handle stress and anxiety since it was keeping me awake at night I should turn over to God the things that were bothering me most <s> He suggested a journal but I am just doing it in prayer <s> I 've been negligent of my prayer life so this is a good way to get back in the habit of talking to God <s> When I was a new believer I used to fall asleep reading his word <s> I sort of miss that comfort and I hope this tiny step will lead me back to that or at least to more consideration in the quiet of the evening when I am lying there trying to shut down my day <s> Last Sunday Matt gave a really good sermon on that included 2 midrash <s> That is may not be spelled correctly and it is not the plural form <s> He told us during the sermon but I didn 't get that bit down <s> One of the midrash talked about the space between the lines of text in the Torah being the place where the true meaning was to be found <s> Then he talked about the name of God as it is in Hebrew YHVH which is never spoken and what the sound might be if we did try to pronounce it <s> Without the vowels that Christians have a 'ed in it sounds sort of like breathy sounds that one hears <s> The PH sound the H sound maybe some of the S those where you are exhaling strongly <s> I kind of laughed when he first did that and tried to say it without the vowels <s> It sounded like a bit from Harry Potter <s> Then as his lesson continued I came to think the breath sound might represent the breath of life that God gives us or that energy which was sent forth from God when he made the world <s> If that is what we find in the quiet spaces maybe it is a good idea that I go back and reread my priests ' sermons so that I can reflect on their teachings and gain what is between the lines of text <s> And that is the second item I a 'ed into Tiny Lifestyle Changes <s> Peace Hope amp Joy If you 've read my blog a lot in the past you know I like to think back on things and see what effect they 've had on my life <s> This is a skill I learned late in life <s> It was something I had to do for some college classes and believe I am much the better for having gained it <s> The process was called reflection <s> Reflection has given me lots of awareness on how things affect others too <s> When I was a child I didn 't spend time analyzing other people is actions or emotions until it affected me and then it was usually a frenzy of trying to look at why they did or said whatever it was that had hurt me so badly <s> That is not socially helpful but it let me express my angst till I 'd owned it and come to a better understanding of the situation <s> Thankfully I 've grown some since those anxious teenage years <s> These days I try to understand the other person is needs or behaviors based on what I know of them and not how I feel <s> It helps a bunch because I 've come to love harmony in my life a gift from Mom and hopefully that longing for peace and harmony makes me more of a peacemaker than an irritant to any situation I run into <s> This morning I was reading an article from <weirdcaps> that talked about a study researching the effects of darkness on people is behavior <s> It said that when the room is darkened not lightless but dim light or people wore sunglasses they might behave in a less ethical manner <s> I found that very interesting and su 'enly I was imagining what I might say to a child who wanted to wear sunglasses all the time because he 'thought it made him look cool ' because another kid he knew wore them and he thought that kid was cool <s> I guess our teachers were right you shouldn 't wear sunglasses all the time <s> Since the eyes are windows to our heart and mind if someone feels you can 't see what he is thinking or feeling he feels anonymous and can thus act in ways that might not be right but won 't be attributed to him because of that self perceived anonymity <s> I think I can understand how a kid might want to be anonymous if he is constantly being corrected for things he does <s> We probably all experience times like that as adults too <s> But knowing this means it is important to look people in the eyes to really know them that it can 't be done by just hearing their words without knowing the emotions behind them or maybe the experiences that have generated their response to a situation <s> That is not always easy to know even when you do look someone in the eye but it gives you the opportunity to ask them for more so that they can express themselves and feel heard <s> I think that is called active listening today and we all know how much we want to be heard when we are struggling <s> I want to go back to that darkness article and think up some more ways that it can affect us so I guess I 'll find a friend I can discuss that with or maybe my counselor since he is good at role play too <s> If you read the article on darkness and come up with any insights I hope you 'll share them <s> Peace Hope amp Joy It is true I am almost gi 'y I am so happy <s> This isn 't because of anything that is happened <s> No major event triggered this <s> I think it is the result of some small changes I made in my routine recently that have just triggered a good feeling within my spirit <s> The changes I made were very small <s> I 've been dealing with depression ever since my marriage broke up in 99 <s> I have a good counselor and maybe a very smart psychiatrist who prescribes my medication <s> So for the past 3 days I 've been on a very small dose of Bupropion <s> Just <date> mg a day extended release <s> This dose is small enough to not cause that edgy feeling that this drug is known for but it helps lift my spirits <s> I think it is taking effect <s> But I don 't think that alone has triggered this surfeit of happiness <s> The next change I made was last night is routine <s> It was cold in the apartment so I took out time in the mi 'le of the evening to draw and take a warm bath <s> I washed my hair and when I was through I put on comfy clothes and went to bed at my usual time hair still wet but combed <s> When I woke up this morning I had more time in my routine to do stuff I wanted to do instead of feeling the need to get ready for work <s> My hair was dry and fluffy call that wash and sleep <s> LOL More time gives you a relaxed feeling about your day so that is going to become a more regular change I think <s> Bath at night and ready faster in the morning <s> Plus I think I slept better for that <s> Good sleep gives me a much better mood <s> Then I elected to dress comfortably for work <s> I work in a business casual environment and some of my coworkers wear suits <s> I would have loved jeans today but it is not jeans day so I pulled out an old pair of loose fitting pants that still looked good and topped them with one of those thin flannel shirts that gives you lots of room to move <s> A 'ed a belt and I am ready for for anything and can move comfortably without care to whether I am sitting like a proper lady and feeling cu 'led in that flannel <s> I think that finished the mood lift <s> So clean rested comfortable and ready to face the day <s> I attribute some of this to the Happiness Project <s> And I am going to continue to read that blog because I keep finding good suggestions in it that lift my mood <s> Hope your day goes as good as I anticipate mine will <s> Peace Hope amp Joy Even though they 'd been sniffing noses through the screen door and seemed interested in being friends when I adopted Hooboo rescuing him from his istray porch kitty ' status he and Hyram developed an instant competition <s> They fought Hyram stole Hooboo is food Hooboo would steal the wrap around my ankles time and they 'd rarely share a bed together <s> Hyram actually kept watch for Hooboo is arrival and left when he entered the room <s> That is until recently <s> I don 't know what changed but for the past two nights I 've had both cats on the bed <s> Sunday night it was one on either side of me <s> Last night they were actually sharing the comforter and less than a foot apart <s> Dare I hope that I 've now got a cat family In other news I am fighting a cold and it is taking

are appreciated <s> Peace Hope amp Joy Recently I updated to the latest greatest version of Firefox that being version 3 6 <s> It immediately disabled IE Tab and one or two other extensions a k a a '-ons <s> Oops I 'd been using IE Tab to see my blog because I thought there had been a problem with Firefox and Blogger <s> I 'd been losing the right hand column of my blog in Firefox and IE Tab was my current workaround <s> Then last night I opened and read Sandi is blog and heard her playlist which she has on the right side same as I do and wondered why I could hear her blog and not mine <s> So I started researching <s> The first thing I did was email Terry to see if he had any advice <s> He took a look with 4 different browsers no less and had no problems with my blog so he suggested I clear the cache <s> That is Blogger is usual advice too so I tried it but it didn 't help <s> Then I got a clever idea <s> Why not try disabling a '-ons to see if any of them were the problem <s> Wow what I discovered would make almost 2 posts <s> First off I had way too many Java Consoles installed <s> Apparently when you update Java it doesn 't overwrite the old console but just a is a new one on <s> I am down to just the latest Java Console and the Java Quick Start a '-on <s> That works fine so no problem there <s> Then I disabled everything else and restarted the browser <s> My blog showed fully and the playlist I 'd been missing played beautifully <s> So I started enabling a '-ons one at a time and found the culprit <s> It was Ad Block Plus <s> That is a sweet a '-on and I am going to miss it because I hate ads being stuck willy nilly all over the pages I am viewing and this baby took care of that <s> But lately it seems to be messing with Java and Flash content so I guess I am better off without <s> Then I googled 'Firefox a '-ons that cause problems with blogger ' and got this fantastic page by Mozilla <s> It lists the extensions that cause problems what they mess up and gives a workaround <s> How helpful of them to put that up <s> It was even dated as recent as December 10 <date> so it is very current <s> Yes Adblock and Adblock Plus were on the list <s> It also told me why my browser sometimes gave a message of Firefox is still running when I 'd shut it down and then tried to restart it <s> That little snafu was thanks to Cooliris which is another neat a '-on but I can do without too <s> So that is gone now too <s> Now my a '-on list is much pared down and I am happy with the way the browser is working again <s> I hope that link helps if you are having any problems with Firefox <s> Peace Hope amp Joy It is raining this morning and in a 'ition to the loving behavior of my younger cat Hooboo making bread on my shoulder before settling down on

the water and people in care facilities like hospitals retirement communities and jails <s> And then there are the people who live in shelters under bridges and overpasses and in boxes <s> Yep we plan on counting them too <s> That thought brings to mind an old black and white movie image of hoboes around a campfire <s> I wonder if they will search railroad cars for people <s> That is the main news on my front <s> I am busy and feeling good about it <s> Yay Other news is that my list of friends on Facebook has grown <s> A bit of that is thanks to Classmates com <s> I am reconnected with a few

before <s> It was a sort of hooting <s> I stopped and listened and it happened again and again <s> It was an owl protesting about light disturbing his peace <s> In all my life I can 't remember ever having heard an owl before but I recognized it immediately <s> Perhaps there is no other bird that sounds like that <s> Maybe it is so distinctive that once you 've been told what an owl sounds like

the sanctuary <s> We call ourselves reconcilers and I think that sound served to remind me that we reconcile ourselves to nature too <s> The Happiness Project had an interesting post the other day about de-cluttering <s> It was rules to not follow <s> In it Gretchen gave Eleven Myths of De-cluttering along with how we should not follow those old beliefs and why <s> I was surprised to find these

<s> When the Brisbane Roar had finished their practice session we decided to go over to see if we could meet some players <s> Geraldo was particularly interested in meeting some Brazilian players who were on the team <s> Most of the players had gone into the change room by the time we had walked over from the other side of the stadium but we were lucky enough to meet a couple of the Brazilian players who were talking to the coach <s> I told them that Geraldo was a top ranking soccer player in his hometown in Vanuatu and they were very friendly and were happy for us to take some snaps <s> The coach whose name was Kenny seemed very interested in Geraldo and he suggested I call his friend David a soccer coach at the Academy of Sport to see if he could include Geraldo in some training sessions before he went back to Vanuatu which was a week away <s> He said there was another Ni-Van boy who was in the training squad there <s> Wow we couldn 't believe our luck We managed to get another photo of Geraldo with a gorgeous Aussie player before we left <s> We drove over to Ballymore Stadium which wasn 't too far and found out the Brisbane Roar did their soccer training at 9 30am in the morning so we all came back the next day to see them practice <s> Geraldo was very excited and watched them intensely <s> We decided that since Geraldo was such a keen soccer player that we should take him for a visit to the Suncorp Stadium where the big soccer games are played <s> The stadium itself was locked up but we could see into it from the stadium shop <s> Of course the stadiums in Vanuatu don 't look like this The fellas who were serving in the shop were very friendly and when we told them that Geraldo was a soccer player from Vanuatu they suggested we take him to another stadium called Ballymore where the Brisbane Roar Brisbane is top soccer team practised <s> On the way home on the <weirdcaps> Geraldo was in high spirits <s> He was really enjoying his stay with us in Brisbane Our next excursion with Geraldo was to take him to the cinema <s> Geraldo had watched plenty of DVDs but had never been to a cinema before as there aren 't any in Vanuatu <s> We chose to take him to a 3D screening of Avatar at South Bank which pretty much blew his mind <s> For the best view of Brisbane we drove Geraldo up to the Mt Cootha lookout <s> There are wonderful views of the city and surrounding areas <s> You can see as far as the Glass House Mountains to the North the Gold Coast Hinterland to the South and Moreton and Stradbroke Islands to the East <s> As usual he was pretty knocked out We actually managed to spot our house through binoculars <s> After our bike run we decided to take Geraldo to Kangaroo Point to check out the views <s> Kangaroo Point is situated on top of a cliff which is now the major rock climbing attraction for Brisbane is abseilers <s> Geraldo was pretty keen on the view <s> Geraldo was really overwhelmed by South Bank <s> He just kept saying 'Oh Man <punctuationfreak> 'He just loved the man made swimming beach <s> The beach consists of a beautiful clear fresh water lagoon with views over the Brisbane River to the city <s> Surrounding landscape consists of white sandy beaches bubbling creeks and shady tropical gardens <s> He couldn 't believe the children is water playground either which I have to admit is pretty cool

Stopped at a traffic light last Friday afternoon I glanced up at a familiar restaurant marquee that usually carried a quip relating to the latest music festival bike rally music rally bike festival in Austin that week <s> However this time the words bore a different sentiment 'Go Texas Win it for Leslie 'The light turned green and I found myself driving south down Congress Avenue with tears pooling at the bottom of my eyelids <s> Every Austinite knows who Leslie is <s> He is the city mascot <s> The epitome of what makes Austin unique <s> For those who do not know him Leslie Cochran is a homeless man who wears a leopard print thong <s> He has run for city mayor multiple times and has been reviewed 53 times on Yelp <s> He is an extremely articulate and sweet-natured man <s> No one has a bad thing to say about Leslie <s> Which is why it is so surprising that unnamed assailants beat Leslie to unconsciousness two weeks ago <s> Leslie was in bad shape and listed in critical condition <s> The townspeople formed a vigil and the local news gave daily updates on his health <s> It was looking like Leslie was not going to make it but miraculously he pulled through and was released from the hospital last week <s> He has since thanked the locals for their support stating that he would have not made it through otherwise <s> Though a percentage of his medical bills have been taken care of there will be a fundraiser on November 1st to help pay the rest <s> By the time I read the sign last Friday I knew that Leslie was alive and well <s> What made me tear up was the realization that I live in a town that cares immensely for an eccentric homeless man <s> It is also a city where that same homeless man can run for mayor multiple times and still get thousands of votes <s> Last month marked my one year anniversary of moving to Austin <s> I moved here with no road map and only what I could fit in my car <s> The plan was to stay a few months and then see where my A ' took me next <s> However whatever energy that made me curious enough to move here has made me stay here <s> I could tell after my first night in Austin that I was someplace special and I haven 't wanted to leave since <s> Each day this city inspires me more and more and at moments I can honestly say that I am in love that could also be because I haven 't had a boyfriend in a long time <s> So in honor of this

for you gifts then we might be interested <s> Humor is a guaranteed way to enter the hearts of millions <s> Take for example Hyperbole-and-a-Half <s> You could learn a lot from her 3 Write About A Trend Topic - I don 't adhere to this rule at all but it is definitely a way to create buzz on your blog <s> Commenting on the cultural importance of 'Jersey Shore 'or how Justin Bieber looks like he should be on the 'L Word 'is a good way to start a convo 4 Befriend Other Bloggers - The blogging community is a tight-knit one <s> I have met people that I am convinced sat next to me at the

you are legit <s> Does it take away from the personal aspect of blogging Sometimes <s> But this is where you have to get clever in how you brand yourself <s> Subliminal branding 7 Photos - Photos are

what you have to say <s> If you believe that your blog will be successful it most likely will <s> Power of suggestion 12 Post a Picture of Your Ass Keep me posted on your progress I am curious to hear

was 'enjoying 'the lovely white fluffy stuff <s> I took this picture of the view behind Ashley is condo <s> Talk about a contrast to the view outside my house Sorry about the delay in the blog posts <s> Ashley and I have been having 'creative differences 'about this blog <s> To make a long story short Ashley read my comment about her and Tarkington and said I CAN 'T BELIEVE YOU TOLD THEM THAT The way I see it Professor Tarkington is MY professor <s> MINE <s> What happens at the law school is my business because these people think that was ME doing all that stuff <s> So why can 't I talk about it Ashley really loves all of you out there and appreciates your support <s> I understand that and I think that is great <s> But it doesn 't mean that you should have the details glossed over or sugar-coated <s> I 'll try to give you hints about Tarkington when I can--until I can figure out a way to give you the whole story <s> How embarrassing that Ashley and I are having a fight on the world is stage <s> This has to be my mom is worst nightmare <s> Back to what happened to me <s> As one of the Commentors pointed out and made me laugh the Twinkie Experiment wasn 't exactly fair--at least at the beginning because Ashley got a nude beach and what did I get Altitude sickness Overall I have to admit I probably did have an easier time with the whole school thing <s> Dr <s> Lyle was in on the Twin Switch so I didn 't have to go into an academic program alone <s> I can 't imagine for my life walking into a law school program like Ashley did <s> I feel bad about laughing but I can 't help it <s> She probably was able to do it because she has this mentality that she can handle anything <s> I don 't think she knows even now what a lion is den she was walking into <s> I had the opposite problem <s> Instead of walking into a room full of law students who practically pee around the room to mark their territory I had the 'huggers 'You know who I am talking about <s> Those people who have to hug you like they haven 't seen you in years and you are a long-lost dear friend <s> I am not a big touchy-feely type person unless it is a really hot guy who is doing the touching and feeling haha <s> It is probably inherent to the whole psychology thing to have them be so tactile <s> Probably something Freudian <s> As I mentioned in an earlier post the party Dr <s> Lyle had at the start of the semester was especially humorous because Ashley didn 't give me a physical description of Robert She told me she didn 't think I 'd run into him So the problem ended up being How do you stay away from someone when you don 't know what they look like One of these days I am going to ask Robert if I actually spoke to him at the party before I knew who he was <s> Have I mentioned that Dr <s> Lyle is husband is hot He is <s> Totally <s> Of course he is a little old and MARRIED but I thought he was really nice looking in a Kevin Costner kind of way Man I might as well delete this paragraph now because I am sure Ashley will have a fit that I said that He was also really sweet and funny <s> He walked around helping the caterers and stuff at the party and every time he 'd see me he 'd say 'So are you caught yet 'Dr <s> Lyle is husband is a psychologist too <s> Can you imagine what their kids must be like <punctuationfreak> The first day of school was pretty anxiety-driven <s> The lack of humidity in the air made my hair have more body <math> something I am definitely not used to since I 've been living at the beach <s> We 're talking flat-head city <s> I have a flippy haircut that is I think darling and the multi-layers and flips make it look not so flat in the humidity <s> But when you take me from a place with 95 percent humidity and drop me into a place with 18 percent humidity well you can imagine what happened <s> The flippiness with a small 'f 'turned into flippiness with a big fat 'F ' <s> And Ashley is not a flippy kind of person <s> She warned me the people up north may not take kindly to a flippy haircut on her <s> I tried to get rid of it <s> Believe me I tried <s> I used water on it after it was dry <s> I used hair spray <s> I curled it under <s> But when I arrived on that huge campus and walked through the wind up hill both ways the hair took on a life of its own <s> And it decided to be flippy <s> And I think I told you last time that when I ran into Paige Ashley is best friend who I 've met a few times when I 've visited Ashley in the past the very first thing out of her mouth was WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH YOUR HAIR <punctuationfreak> Not 'Hi how are you 'or 'how was your summer ' but a rude announcement that might as well have sai ' <weirdcaps> Everyone Look over here at this ugly hair 'It is no secret that I am not a big fan of Paige <s> As this blog goes on I think you 'll understand why <s> The hair thing started it though <s> So much for integrating quietly into the crowd <s> Everyone had to notice me and my hair <s> Which only brought on more hugging since that is what psych students do <s> What a big difference class was compared to law school <s> The psych seminar actually had donuts and coffee for the students And the first day was spent going around the room introducing ourselves <s> Students actually talked amongst themselves WHILE Dr <s> Lyle was talking <s> And she didn 't kill them <s> Not to mention how nice everyone was to each other <s> We also didn 't have to read for the first day which was weird <s> Some people didn 't even have their textbooks yet <s> I was in shock <s> The most fun on the first day was finally seeing who the notorious Robert was <s> He wasn 't anything like I had imagined him from Ashley is comments <s> And I don 't remember seeing him at Dr <s> Lyle is party <s> He is tall -- almost 6 feet slim but not skinny or fat <s> Dresses pretty nice <s> Dark hair and dark warm eyes with wire-rim glasses <s> I usually don 't like guys with glasses but he was an exception <s> Okay I admit it I thought Robert was cute from the very first day <s> But it is not like I hit on him or anything <s> I intended to keep my distance and not even speak to him <s> He sat in the row in front of us and Paige leaned over to me and sai ' <weirdcaps> guess he wants to make sure you 've seen him 'And in typical Paige-fashion she said it loudly enough for him to hear <s> The girl sitting on the other side of me who I called 'The Screamer 'for awhile since I didn 't know her name of course had to say hi to Robert <s> She was like leaning forward with her desk they are the individual desks not like the rows of tables in law school in front of me to ask Robert how his summer was <s> When he turned around he just kind of looked at me for a second and then sai ' <weirdcaps> 'Real big conversationalist <s> The first day of class left me with one major question WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO PSYCHOLOGY <punctuationfreak> I took a few courses in college and I 've read stuff through the years <s> But somehow they changed it <s> It is no longer the common sense intuitive get in touch with your inner-child is feelings bring memories to the surface bells ringing

Morrighan and my twin sister is name is Ashley--who most of you already know <s> Just a brief background in case you are just joining us <s> Ashley and I are twenty-seven year old identical twins <s> Ashley is in her third year of graduate school working towards her Doctorate in Psychology <s> Her emphasis is on Twin Studies at the University of ______ I still can 't put the name of her school She lives up North where it snows more than I would like but otherwise it is beautiful <s> Ashley is best friend is named Paige <s> Ashley used to like a guy named Robert until the great AC DC Concert Incident last summer <s> Robert and Paige are also psych doctoral students <s> Although Paige is more into Abnorrmal Psychology which is understandable if you 've ever met her <s> Sorry that was petty <s> Bad Amy bad <s> While Ashley is in grad school I am in my second year a '2L ' in law school <s> I can 't give my exact location but I can tell you I live on the coast <s> My interest in law has primarily been in the area of Intellectual Property <s> But I also am interested in other areas which span across the board <s> They say the first year of law school is the worst and mine was no exception <s> In fact I can honestly say last year was the worst year I 've ever had <s> The coursework itself is challenging but not as hard as they make it out to be <s> It wasn 't the work itself I found challenging since I actually like studying the law <s> The people in my life you 've probably heard the most about are my professors for this past semester who Ashley encountered Professor Rogerson Professor Tarkington and Professor Mathews <s> My two closest friends or at least they were up until the Twin Switch are Vicki and Beth <s> I am probably closest to my next-door neighbor Charlie who has taken in a whole lot of his kids and grandkids to live with him <s> He basically has a big ol ' heart and loves to feed and take care of people <s> And dogs <s> He has a beach house right next to mine and actually owns mine too though he rents it out to me <s> Ashley and I are the only kids in our family <s> Our parents live in can I say where they live No Okay They live in a place that is cold too <s> We have great parents who support us financially and emotionally while we are in school <s> Neither of our parents were supposed to know about the Twin Switch but that changed when Ashley told Mom <s> More details about that later <s> We ultimately decided to do the Twin Switch for several reasons 1 <s> Everyone always asks us if we ever switch places and we wanted to see if we could pull it off now that we 're adults 2 <s> Ashley is working on her dissertation involving twins and she wanted to see if her advisor would let her incorporate the data from the switch somehow <s> Her advisor Dr <s> Lyle said she would review Ashley is and my data at the end of the switch to see if there was anything workable for the dissertation <s> I am sure Ashley will give you the scoop on that 3 <s> As mentioned above I had a hard time with law school and was about to give up on it and I wanted to see if there was anything Ashley could do while she was there as me <s> Of course I didn 't -exactly- tell Ashley how bad things were or how much I was relying on her for help <s> But that is because I didn 't know how things would be for her <s> And she told me over and over not to say anything that would alter her behavior during the twin switch <s> Ashley and I also started off trying to think of a bet <s> I would bet we could pull off the switch because I always knew we could and Ashley would bet we couldn 't <s> Unfortunately we couldn 't ever agree on what we would put for the wager <s> Looking back on it I guess we could have used Robert Just ki 'ing The whole thing seemed pretty funny at first and we both had our doubts as to if we would actually even give it a try <s> Then Ashley flew down to visit me and we started getting our hair and nails done to match each other <s> I thought Ashley was going to catch the first flight out when I gave her a tour of the law school showed her where everything was where to sit etc <s> I think that is when reality set in for her <s> I had no idea how freaked out she was until after the switch was over and she admitted what she did the weekend right before school started <s> Ashley told me I shouldn 't mention anything about it but I 'll see if I can put the details in <s> Let is just say Ashley didn 't tell you EVERYTHING she did during the switch <s> I think many of you would be surprised and amused if you heard it all <s> As for me you haven 't heard everything that I went through either <s> Ash and I have agreed to keep this Rated G or PG since we have no idea how old our readers are <s> Sorry that means no graphic details about what went on between Ashley and Professor Tarkington Can I mention that Ashley No Okay You didn 't hear that from me <s> I left for Ashley is condo up North on the weekend right before school started <s> Leaving the ocean was a lot harder than I thought it would be <s> I really felt a loss for some reason and it wasn 't until much later that I figured out why with Robert is and Ashley is help <s> It felt like I was leaving my swingset or something <s> When we were little Ashley and I had the coolest swingset in our back yard with the monkeybars along the top with a swing the rings glider etc <s> It was awesome <s> Then my dad took a job in another state and we had to move <s> Without the swingset <s> Ash and I were mortified and actually grieved for our swingset <s> Anyway that is the same grief I felt when I left the coast and it was haunting for me <s> I couldn 't understand it because I figured the Twin Switch wouldn 't last THAT long and I could go back anytime I wanted thanks to frequent flier miles <s> When the switch ended and Ashley and I were able to sit down and go over everything it was then Ashley told me what she had discovered regarding identity issues for twins during our twin switch <s> It feels like you are leaving yourself behind when you switch places with your twin <s> Anything that is not exactly like your twin you have to cut off <s> Completely <s> Otherwise people who knew Ashley would never believe I was her <s> It is not just leaving my 'life 'that was hard <s> It was leaving ME all the things about me that I like fish crabs etc and having to mentally train myself to like what Ashley likes or Ashley does <s> Mentally it has more of an effect on you that you might think <s> I could never have anticipated how much it would effect me <s> So I arrive up north and I hope I can tell you this part I had Altitude Sickness for awhile because her condo is near the mountains <s> Going from sea-level to the mountains took some getting used to <s> I had migraine-like headaches for awhile <s> Other than that escaping the 98 degree temperatures and <math> humidity was fabulous <punctuationfreak> My hair just seemed to come alive for some reason <s> This of course meant I had to deal with the flippiness of my haircut <s> I have a medium length shorter-cut which is cut to flip in the back <s> Ashley said 'no way 'would Paige or anyone believe she would ever have a flippy cut <s> It was a constant battle between me and my hair there for awhile <s> And on my first day of class the first words out of Paige is mouth when she saw me was 'WHAT IS <smiley> WITH YOUR HAIR 'I met with Dr <s> Lyle the Saturday before school started <s> Ashley thinks this woman is so great but to be honest she didn 't make that great of a first impression on me <s> She came across very isnooty 'almost--not very friendly to me at all <s> Ash says it is because she is from the North and 'that is how some Northerners are 'but I don 't buy it <s> Everyone else was really nice <s> I also think Dr <s> Lyle had her own agenda with the twin switch <s> There were times when I definitely thought she purposely set me up to fail so she could see if anyone could tell I wasn 't really Ashley <s> Dr <s> Lyle had a student reception at her house that night which gave me a chance to be around the Psych people before classes started <s> Of course Ashley didn 't describe Robert for me so I didn 't know what he looked like <s> She told me just to ignore him anyway since I was supposed to be her <s> Ashley was mad at Robert because he never called her after their one date they had that ended in disaster <s> So the plan was for me to just stay away from him <s> I don 't think Ashley realized that Robert was signed up to be in the same seminar as I was <s> It was just a matter of time before I ran into him <s> At Dr <s> Lyle is party however I tried to avoid him <s> But how do you avoid someone when you don 't know what that person looks like <punctuationfreak> There was a girl at the party named Jamie who walked over to me first thing and wanted to know how my 'date with Robert 'went <s> I told her I didn 't want to talk about it and she sai ' <weirdcaps> that is because he is HERE isn 't he 'I almost freaked out right then because for all I knew I had already been talking to him and been sickly-sweet and nice like I was trying to be to everyone I encountered <s> Later during the party Jamie came up to me again to let me know she saw Robert in the livingroom <s> I tried to sneak a peek at the guys in the livingroom to see if I could guess which guy my sister would like <s> I didn 't have Robert pegged right though <s> I still can 't remember if I actually talked to him or not before I knew who he was <s> If I did I am sure he thought it was weird because on Monday when I really did find out who he was I intentionally stayed away from him <s> Well I wanted to give ya 'll some background on me and to kind of let you know where things started <s> This has been just some general comments and next I 'll try to get into the details more <s> Hi Everybody I took this picture right out in front of Charlie is and Amy is beach houses <s> It is my favorite time of day--sunset <s> I apologize for not posting sooner <s> Things have been pretty hectic as you can probably imagine <s> Thanks to everyone for your kind emails to Traci that she forwarded to me <s> It has meant a great deal <s> As I think Traci posted already Amy would like to have a chance to give her side of the istory 'She read my blog postings which is okay since I was trying to get her to switch back and told her where the site was so she could know what is been going on in her life <s> She isn 't actually mad or anything she just wants people to see how things were for her before they judge her <s> I told her no one is judging anybody <s> Life is life and we 're all human <s> Let he who is without sin cast the first stone so to speak <s> I hope you all will enjoy Amy is side of things <s> She was going to post her own blog all along but she wasn 't sure who she could trust to get things out there without getting caught <s> We had some close calls and given her background at the law school she had to be extra extra careful <s> She did keep a journal though with entries so she can make postings rather than throw it all out there all at once <s> I am not sure what format she is going to use though <s> I think it also depends on Traci <s> I suspect it will be a little at a time <s> I told Amy she should try and publish the information in a book somehow since the information is already writen instead of re-writing it as a blog <s> Plus there are some details both of us experienced that we didn 't and still don 't feel comfortable putting on the computer I think you guys might like to hear some of that stuff as well--cough cough <s> So this will give Amy a chance to give you a preview of what a book might say--only the Rated G PG blog version <s> I know from my experience that it is really easy to form opinions about someone by watching someone else living their life <s> So all I ask is that you not be too hard on me or her as you hear what Amy has been up to in my life o Thanks again for your friendship and support during the past months <s> God Bless you Merry Christmas Happy Holidays Ashley Morrighan Hi this is Traci again <s> I know everyone is waiting to hear what happened with the Twin Swtich -- I have been waiting too very impatiently <s> I finally heard from Ashley and thankfully she and Amy have patched things up <s> Or at least they are speaking to one another <s> Amy apparently discovered and read over this blog and was pretty ticked off which I think we can all understand <s> She is now demanding equal time to give her side of what happened <s> And she wants it before Ashley tells everyone how things ended up with the Robert situation and the Twin Swtich <s> Ashley asked me this morning if I would mind posting some blog entries from Amy <s> I don 't mind doing it but I wanted to run it by our audience out there first <s> I 've gotten numerous emails from people over the past 4 or 5 months begging me for information about Amy <s> It looks like you 'll finally find out what happened <s> Just let me know if it is something you 're still interested in <s> Please just post your opinion on the 'Comments 'And I guess we 'll take it from there <s> Thanks Traci Campbell Blog Administrator Hi This is Traci the Blog Administrator <s> Ashley asked me to post this message for her <s> We apologize for the silence on the blog lately part of it was my fault because I went out of town for two weeks <s> Ashley is still trying to get things straightened out with Amy <s> Amy still is trying to tell Robert SHE is Ashley and neither Amy nor Robert will talk to Ashley Ashley is mom or dad <s> Law school for the semester is winding down <s> Ashley even though she is ticked off at Amy doesn 't want Amy to lose her legal education and chance at becoming a lawyer <s> So she tried to drop the classes for the semester--saying she needed a leave of absence for family reasons <s> The dean said no he sounds like a MAJOR jerk to me about Business Associations and Criminal Procedure since those classes are required <s> She can and did drop the Intellectual Property class <s> She also quit being Tarkington is Research Assistant 'due to family reasons 'that are taking up her time <s> Tarkington apparently was more understanding than the dean <s> Which is good considering Ashley doesn 't know squat about legal writing <s> So where everything stands right now <s> Ashley has no choice but to try and take the final exams for Business Associations and Criminal Procedure <s> We all know it is a long shot <s> Talk about pressure Richard the guy who worked in the Law Clinic is helping her study by the way <s> Whether or not Ashley can pass the exams <s> I guess we 'll have to wait and see <s> But that is where she is and what is going on right now <s> I am sure you 'll hear from Ashley once the exams are over <s> Keep your fingers crossed for her <s> Traci Campbell Things have been kind of hectic and I apologize to everyone for not posting sooner Here is the basic scoop on what is been going on 1 <s> Rogerson seems to have backed off for right now <s> Our Operation HERB actually seems to have worked Yea <punctuationfreak> 2 <s> Amy and Robert have apparently gotten serious <s> Like way serious <s> <repeatedchars> 3 <s> Exams at the law school start in just a few WEEKS from now <s> Major <repeatedchars> 4 <s> And here is the biggest thing of all <s> AMY IS REFUSING TO SWITCH BACK Monsterous <repeatedchars> Amy says she is worried about what Robert is going to say if she tells him we switched places so she is continuing to let him think she is ME <s> I tried to call her and she won 't talk to me about it <s> I 've sent emails and she won 't respond <s> I 've been frazzled about this situation because at first I thought Amy was joking <s> How can she not come back here I thought the snow and cold would have sent her back here faster than anything but I guess Robert is keeping her warm I also am having a cow about Amy abandoning her law school <s> I understand that things were bad with Rogerson--believe me I understand But this is ridiculous <s> We need to come up with a plan and the plan can 't involve the idea of ME taking her exams <s> No matter what she says I can 't think of a worse nightmare than Law Exams <s> I am flying up tonight to visit my parents for Thanksgiving <s> The only thing I can think to do is explain everything to my parents and see if they can talk some sense into Amy <s> No Amy won 't be there <s> She is having Thanksgiving with Robert is family <s> I 'll fill you in on other stuff going on like with Mick and the research thing as soon as I can

showing you the inked glass image too <s> You can see here there is a modest about of paint smeared across the glass <s> This drawing was made after several previous drawings <s> Here is the first drawing I made during a brief session this morning <s> I had prepared the glass and left it a short while to allow the water-based oil paint to dry just a little <s> I thought I would work on a simple series of drawings to demonstrate - so chose one of my 'things ' - long-eared things rabbits and hares <s> I made a series of little quirky rabbit drawings <s> Because my inked glass was smaller than the paper area I lifted and shifted the paper so that is why the glass does not match up with the drawing I attempted to draw a girl holding a rabbit <s> Wishing to aim for a quite primitive drawing <s> You can see my attempts starting left to right <s> I like the first drawing best - because it features an echo of a previous drawing left in the ink and because I like the really smudgy drawings <s> Shadow girl and rabbit Various drawings showing the different quality of line achieved in one drawing session <s> Here you can see my first drawing in the centre and then as I continued to draw so I switched paper to a smoother cartridge paper that is best for showing fine line <s> Further tips experiment with using different inks paints and colours <s> Do not limit yourself to one type of paper <s> I also try and use old envelopes fabric tissue paper etc <s> If you are wishing to try this with young children or less able folk and would prefer not to use glass -

<s> Dreaming of traveling to Buenos Aires Argentina The makers of Bueno entonces the hot new Spanish language learning software are trying to build their Facebook cred by reaching 10 <date> Fans by March <s> If they get there one lucky fan and a friend will win a trip to Buenos Aires Argentina for 10 days of intensive Spanish lessons a chance to meet the cast and crew and me too and of course have way too much fun <s> From now until March 12th Bueno entonces is offering a series of contests on the Facebook Page which offers free daily Spanish phrases words and grammar lessons <date> participants will be chosen as Finalists from the series of contests and will be entered to win the Grand Prize Trip <s> The complete contest details are posted on the Bueno entonces <s> Fan Page <s> They 've to a super-simple photo contest <s> To enter just snap a picture of yourself holding a sign saying 'I want to win a trip to Argentina 'and post it to their Facebook wall <s> Then get your friends to 'like ' and comment on it <s> But HURRY The TEN finalists with the most 'likes ' will be selected on Friday February 5 <s> So polish up your tango shoes and hurry and go check it out <s> About the program Bueno entonces is like Rosetta Stone meets The Simpsons - the program is comprehensive but at the same time hilarious and really engaging <s> Just released last year it has been already featured in the <weirdcaps> App Store and on the Daily Candy website <s> To see more check out their Learn Spanish website <s> I have taken my share of Spanish classes believe me <s> Some were good some were not so good <s> But none were as funny or as motivating as the Bueno entonces program <s> Witty and wry with more than a bit of adult humor it is like watching a favorite <smiley> show--you can 't wait for the next episode Though it is definitely geared to the twentysomething crowd even old folks like Tom and me laughed out loud during many of the lessons <s> It is sexy--in a fun way <s> And since this is the Sexy Spanish Club blog well I feel that I must recommend this as it is THE sexiest Spanish-learning program out there <s> The two characters--the hot Argentine teacher Jimena and the kinda goofy student David definitely develop a certain chemistry <s> It makes it fun <s> Will they--or won 't they I am not telling - For those planning on visiting Argentina you should know that this is the ONLY Argentine-oriented Spanish program available <s> It tells you how to pronounce things the Argentine way and includes plenty of cultural references and helpful and entertaining slang <s> Plus it is portable it can be instantly downloaded to your <weirdcaps> <weirdcaps> Smartphone or laptop <s> No need for that sweaty bus or Subte ride to a class and no books to lug around--just plug in and learn and laugh What are you waiting for gringo Get started on your own sexy Spanish here <s> No not really <s> Though it is true that my husband and I just bought a small farm in Uruguay we are keeping our studio apartment in Buenos Aires and plan to visit regularly <s> After all it is only two hours away and we have two daughters living in Buenos Aires and many friends--and though we plan to live a quiet life in the country focusing on farming and writing we will want a blast of city life every now and then Why did we buy the farm It was unexpected <s> We visited some friends--an expat couple British and French who had spent twenty years in New York--who had just purchased a farm <s> We saw how they were living and it was just so appealing that we couldn 't get the idea out of our heads <s> Two weeks later we 'd bought our own place or at least started the process <s> The real estate transaction went very well--quick smooth very nice owners who worked with us directly without using an agent <s> What appeals to us about it is the challenge of living even more simply of connecting to the land developing re-developing <s> I grew up on a farm our skills in terms of planting growing and harvesting our own food and living in a <math> year-old farmhouse without succumbing to our American instincts to redo and rebuild <s> It is beautifully simple as is but not perfect--and we are looking forward to being okay with that <s> Most of all we love the idea of investing in land of being in a beautiful place and getting to know our neighbors in a setting that encourages cooperation bartering and sharing <s> And okay I can 't help but think that it will be a really fun place for our eventual grandkids to visit - But Buenos Aires is in my heart and always will be <s> I love it and I really appreciate the creativity of the people locals and expats <s> It inspires me makes me think makes me laugh and helps me appreciate life <s> I know I 'll feel the same way about life on the farm in Uruguay--but in different ways <s> Thought I 'd update this blog--I am posting regularly on my New Globals blog these days <s> I 've even posted some fun little videos about finding my book in Barnes amp Noble and meeting my agent for the first time I wrote the book in Argentina and did everything via email and most recently seeing my book in a bookstore window here in New York <s> My book The New Global Student Skip the SAT Save Thousands on Tuition and Get a Truly International Education was published by Random House on the 19th and Tom and I are in New York for a month <s> Generally authors do a book tour sort of thing but we 're doing things differently We 've had a great time hanging out with three of our daughters here celebrated when our oldest earned her master is degree at <math> and started a new job this week and just enjoying life in the East Village <s> We were excited to see the print edition of Smithsonian Magazine on the racks this week As I am sure many of you know their cover story for the June edition is about living in Buenos Aires and several expats are quoted including me <s> Thanks for that Daniel Politi - The interview was done well over a year ago but the timing worked out very well as it was published the same week as my book launched There was a glitch in the shipment of books to the many education bloggers organizations and others who were supposed to receive an early copy in order to build some buzz <s> We found out just last week that the books are still sitting in the warehouse Argh <s> This seriously hampers marketing efforts as you can imagine so we 're doing a little damage control and scrambling <s> In fact things are likely to pick up in a big way soon later this week a short feature on the book will be published in USA Today and a review is scheduled to appear in the Boston Globe either the 7th or the 14th Sunday editions <s> I 've had some radio interviews and podcasts so far and Tom and I are learning a lot in our lunch sessions with parents a group of parents buys us lunch we listen to their concerns about their kids ' education and share tips <s> In fact we had a fabulous one in Westport Connecticut last Friday with a dozen people in attendance <s> Tom was the only guy but hey he is used to that <s> Most of all we 're just enjoying the moment and feeling grateful for the opportunity to have a book published and get a chance to share this message with those who can benefit from it <s> If you or someone you know is strugging with college costs disheartened by the college-prep hassle looking for inexpensive ways to study abroad or just ready to hear some GOOD news about U <s> S education I hope you 'll consider reading or recommending my book Learn more at http <repeatedchars> <s> <weirdcaps> com It is also full of inspiring stories and helpful advice for anyone-- especially families --considering spending time abroad <s> And to all you aspiring writers in Buenos Aires and elsewhere <math> keep at it Two years ago I had no idea what I would write about and though I hoped I 'd write a book someday I was like millions of other people with the same vague dream <s> Keep dreaming but more importantly keep writing You just never know where it can take you <s> Yep <s> It is true <s> Oh it is not that we don 't love it <s> It is been fantastic <s> We chose this location just on the edge of Belgrano three years ago when we had two daughters living with us and it couldn 't have been more perfect in terms of proximity to their schools--Islands International School and Universidad de Belgrano and an easy bus or train ride to Lincoln University College <s> Just a couple of blocks from the Subte D line Congreso de Tucuman stop so you almost always get a seat and four blocks from the NuÒez train station with bus 29 running right in front of our apartment as well <s> We have great neighbors and our sweet little street is quiet with very friendly people <s> Our building Love it <s> Only three years old with a lovely pool and parilla area on the roof a small gym and a large sauna <s> There are only two apartments on each floor and ours is facing the back instead of the street <s> Despite the fact that we 're only a couple of blocks from Cabildo what wakes us up in the morning is birds in the trees below we 're on the seventh floor <s> So why are we selling it Well regular readers will know that I just wrote a book and in May Tom and I will be going to the <smiley> for the book launch and promotional tour and we have no idea how long we will be staying <s> It could be two months but it might be six or eight months depending on speaking engagements and other opportunities <s> Also we purchased a studio apartment in Palermo right on Paraguay between Armenia and Malabia that has been under construction and will be completed in the next month or so <s> PLUS our four daughters seem reasonably launched and as empty nesters we just don 't need three bedrooms <s> We really like to change things up and we 've always wanted to try living in a studio apartment so Tom and I are excited to move into the little one <s> That means we 've decided to sell this one despite our daughters ' concerns we 've assured them that we 're likely to buy another place--with at least a spare bedroom--once we get back here after the tour stuff is over <s> Luckily the wonderful realtor who sold us this place--Javier--is a friend and is helping us sell this one as well <s> He works with Cristian Bau realtors here in Buenos Aires and he is such a good man a pleasure to work with and we trust him completely <s> By the way buying property here isn 't hard as long as you 've got the cash since there aren 't really any mortgages--we saw this place bought it and MOVED INTO IT--all within a month <s> So anyway--if you or someone you know might be interested in buying a really nice three-bedroom two bath apartment in a great location--and we 're happy to sell most of the furnishings as well for a VERY reasonable price--let us know <s> It is been a fantastic place for our family and I know that whoever ends up lucky enough to live here next will enjoy it as much as we have <s> To see the listing with photos go to SOLD--NEVER MIND Maya is hard at work on her other blogs so I her husband Tom wanted to use her traffic to recommend a guided kayak tour of the Delta that I took last week <s> I have been up to Tigre and the Delta several times it is only about 30 minutes from our apartment in Belgrano via train <s> Though the town of Tigre itself is worth a trip I generally skip it to get out to the islands in the Delta <s> Generally we have taken the Interisla Collectivos passenger boats that act as buses between the islands and have gotten off at a restaurant pier or someplace else to go hiking <s> We have also rented a house for a weekend <s> But what I really wanted to do was explore the myriad of small canals and channels that the larger boats cannot get into <s> Based on fellow expat Jonathan Harada is advice http tutoramigos blogspot com we contacted Martin at <repeatedchars> eldoradokayak com <s> Martin met us at the station and had already purchased tickets for the collectivo boat out to their island camp <s> I have been on the same route before though it was totally different as Martin is very knowledgeable about the Delta and during the entire 1 5 hour boat ride he gave us great information about the route <s> The last stop of the collectivo is their camp house <s> Serenely quiet the small canal had very few houses <s> All that we could hear was the winds in the leaves and the chirping of the birds <s> Martin is partner Chapa had a light lunch ready for us set nicely around a picnic table in the jungle clearing <s> Their house is simple but new clean with full changing and shower facilities <s> After a brief instruction on pa 'ling techniques we set off in double and singles--very stable kayaks that were almost brand new <s> Time is different in the Delta and the two-three hours we spent blissfully pa 'ling the small canals and channels flew by <s> My two daughters were hesitant to go initially worried they were not strong enough and completely enjoyed the experience <s> Our route took us through darker narrow passages as well as past grand houses on one of the larger rivers and then into seemingly untouched portions of jungle <s> When we got back a lovely lunch of sausage sandwiches tomato salad and vino patero awaited <s> Chapa and Martin are wonderful conversationalists and our hour lunch turned into a three hour again time in the Delta is different discussion of Argentine politics culture and life on the Delta <s> When you visit Buenos Aires take this tour you will not be disappointed <s> I have traveled a fair bit and the Delta is like nowhere I have been before and Eldorado Kayaks let me see it up close and personal <s> Some people like to do the look-back-over-the-last-year thing on December 31st <s> I prefer to do the what-a-cool-year-it is-going-to-be thing on New Year is Day <s> For the Frost family lots of good things are in store and already in motion <s> Observe --My book The New Global Student will be in bookstores on May 19th <s> So the next six months will be devoted to pre-launch publicity as well as sketching out Book Two <s> Lots of exciting times ahead as we start to get media attention for the book --Tom and I are working together <s> We worked together as English teachers in rural Japan when we met back in <date> and over the years we 've had businesses together and worked side by side <s> But we 've always had our own projects <s> This year I am very excited that he will be working directly with me on the business nonprofit projects related to my book We 've always been far better together than apart so there is no stopping us now - --Our oldest daughter she is <math> will complete her master is in May <s> She is been working full time in a 'ition to earning her master is so May will bring some relief but also new opportunities <s> Cool --Daughter Number Two just turned <math> graduated from college in December and finished two internships in Manhattan--one at a Latino ad agency one at MTV international <s> Now she is very happily working in an Irish pub she LOVES it while saving money and also working as a freelancer for the ad agency <s> It is great to learn how to do freelance work and negotiate for good pay at the age of 21 <s> This weekend she is moving into a new apartment she is been living with her older sister since August and is thrilled to be living in New York and doing her thing --Daughter Number Three also graduated from college in December she is <math> and was offered a job as a multilingual events coordinator for a major cruise line <s> Unfortunately the earliest they can place her in a position is March so she is arriving in Buenos Aires today to spend the next couple of months relaxing traveling and possibly pursuing other work options if the cruise thing is taking too long --Daughter Number Four she is <math> is here in Buenos Aires now on her winter break from college in upstate New York <s> It is a chance to visit us visit her boyfriend okay we know he gets top billing and see what it is like to come back to Argentina after being away for a few months <s> She is going to meet her boyfriend is family out in the campo country for a few days which should be interesting <s> She 'll return to New York in a couple of weeks continue her studies and do an internship this summer <s> It looks like she 'll graduate with a BS in Applied Psychology organizational psych really in December <s> It is a year of growth opportunities and changes--exactly what we love best - Happy New Year everyone Tom and I had a great time at Normal 0 Mar de AjÛ--just the two of us the beach the sun <s> Though I expected more wistful moments--this being our first Christmas in 22 years without kids--there were actually just a few and we thoroughly enjoyed celebrating Christmas in a sleepy beach town <s> It is not sleepy now though--the holiday crowds were arriving as we left There was much painting and sprucing up being done during the time we were there <s> It was great to be the only foreigners around--everywhere we went people asked where we were from were very friendly and interested and we had delightful conversations with the locals we met <s> Not so nice--I caught Tom is cold I guess I had time to get sick so I did and thanks to some pretty horrible coughing yesterday I seem to have a cracked or at the very least very sore rib <s> So just as I was during my recovery from gum surgery a few months back I am VERY QUIET <s> It hurts to breathe let alone talk laugh or OUCH cough <s> But the good news is that I got my first blurb for my book--from Dan Pink author of A WHOLE NEW MIND <s> I loved Dan is book so I am utterly thrilled and humbled and awed that he wrote such a nice blurb for my book cover <s> Here it is 'With considerable verve and tremendous insight Maya Frost offers a primer on how to take your education -- and your life -- into your own hands <s> THE NEW GLOBAL STUDENT is essential reading for any family yearning to step off the treadmill and plunge into the world '-- Daniel H <s> Pink author of A WHOLE NEW MIND Nice huh I am looking forward to getting more blurbs soon--they are being sent to my editor at Random House Crown and she is out of the office until January 6th <s> Dan just sent his along to me as a courtesy since he knew I was on pins and needles <s> It is especially meaningful coming from Dan as he is a father of three and took his kids on a sabbatical to Japan while doing research for his manga career guide The Adventures of Johnny Bunko <s> So quiet and thrilled <s> Not a bad way to spend the next couple of days -

<s> I plan to stop being a public personal storyteller <s> Let me explain I went to TED last month which is a conference in Long Beach and was asked to perform a 3 minute story in between speakers I got up and told this story about Mulan learning about sex for the first time I call it the Mulan-frog story it begins with frogs It got big laughs and even a partial standing ovation at the end People really loved it and I was so high and happy afterwards I am proud that I have the skill to tell a good story and make people laugh <s> I have a million happy memories of being onstage and making people laugh There is always a dark side however I am usually telling some story that could embarrass another person or I am talking about something that irritates me about someone specific When I got home from the conference I realized that if Mulan saw my story or a fellow student did she could be very embarrassed I was mortified and could not believe that I hadn 't considered this before Mulan looks good in the story a curious smart nine year old But the whole topic is embarrassing to a girl her age I was really struck deeply about what I do onstage and the fact that I have a child I hated telling stories about my mother because I knew that it could be hurtful but I did it anyway because I loved getting the laugh I loved getting to vent and I felt I had the right somehow to talk about her onstage I guess I thought there was some sort of unwritten code that made parents fair game I actually feel that is true and if Mulan grows up and tells stories about me no matter how unflattering I will gladly accept that as her right I 'll be in the front row no wait More lovingly I will not be anywhere near the place But the other way around me telling stories about her That is different <s> After much agonizing little niggling things that I have hated for a long time about performing stories about my own life fulminated to the surface I no longer wish to be so naked and bare I am surprised I ever did want to do it Don 't get me wrong I am glad I did I am proud that I learned to craft my experiences into a story and I am proud that I learned the craft of being on-stage But now I need to stop doing it I am happily married for one thing and it is boring and inappropriate to talk about My daughter is ten and she reads my blog OMG she goes to my shows In fact we have spoken at length about the stories I tell about her Not that at ten she is really capable of understanding the ramifications Still she says it is okay to tell the Mulan-frog story But ugh I don 't think she really understands I feel the need to protect her from myself In some ways this is just another example of our Internet age When I started telling stories about my life it was in a basement club in L <s> A called Luna Park in <date> where the maximum capacity was 50 people We were recording the shows but it wasn 't for mass consumption What I mean is that I could speak as if it were 'off the record ' This lulled me into a sense of secrecy and intimacy and allowed me to say anything no matter how raw I was uncensored <s> But there is no more 'off-the-record ' anymore Anything can be posted online Immediately I think this is on balance good it makes people accountable in a new and direct way But for me well let is just say I would probably never have begun telling stories about my personal life if I 'd thought they could be available to any interested person instantly But once I started I got used to the open-nature of talking about my life I learned to live with the downsides the embarrassment possibly even when it hurt or embarrassed other people Then when blogging came along it seemed like such a natural thing to do Jill Sobule and I have been working for a few years now doing a show together I tell about ten to fourteen stories in our show She sings songs I tell stories We have worked hard to make the show work dramatically and musically <s> I think we 've succeeded In fact I think our show is at least as good as any other show I 've done maybe better I am glad I tell all those stories in our show But I don 't want to tell any more The stories that are out there well they 're out there But then after this well I want to retire from it At least for a while Maybe forever I dunno <s> We have about 12 scheduled shows for this year <math> Mostly in the summertime and mostly in the Northeast and the Northwest After talking this over with Jill we have agreed to do those shows We may actually a ' a show or two We may also find a way to film our show in the autumn But by the end of this year I plan to stop doing this show And then face <date> not performing <s> I haven 't written in my blog because I am always so suspicious of any type of big revelation or big announcement I almost felt that if I announced that I was going to stop performing there would inevitably be some reason not to stop it I have mulled this over for the last month or so And it feels good It feels right <s> Sometimes I feel that my creativity and not just mine but everyone is creativity is like the snow on a mountaintop melting a little at a time All my various outlets performing and writing in all its manifestations -- create little rivers through which the snow can melt I always liked having so many things going at once I always felt that in show business you had to have five pots on the stove just to get one of them to boil I benefited from being so multi-able I could do voice over and then perform at a club I could write a monologue and then write a pilot for a <smiley> show But lately it feels that I have fragmented my focus with this policy I want the snow to melt into a couple of larger rivers not into several smaller streams And so after the TED experience I found myself wondering what I am doing with myself How am I directing my energies I began to look at the darker side of telling stories about my personal life The guilt the anguish the desire to emphasize this over that the slant the small or large exaggeration the worry that someone I am talking about will see or hear me Then I suppose you could say the tipping point was Mulan <s> Also many things have changed I am now more able to be isolated having moved to the Midwest from Los Angeles and conversely I am now in more regular and intimate interdependence with people I guess what I mean is that I have a husband and a child There is already a lot of interaction in my life and I have begun to crave more and more alone time I desire privacy I don 't want my personality to be so known anymore My personality has been so slutty Time to join a convent So in the last few weeks I have beta-tested my new views And it is already had such forceful and creative results I am focusing on a couple of screenplays with my writing partner Jim Emerson I may or may not finish writing the memoir of my letting go of God time 'My Beautiful Loss-of-Faith Story ' Of course I 'll do the Jill amp Julia shows with Jill Sobule during this year Then I plan to hang up my mouth I can see Jill and I doing another show someday but not until way into the future If she wants to In ten years I do honestly have that fantasy Or I can imagine that I will change in a few yea rs time and want to get back up on stage Or maybe I will develop the skills to talk about things that aren 't so personal and private like many other comics do That could happen But I doubt it And at the very least I doubt it for the foreseeable future <s> Anyway here I am making a big pronouncement just what I didn 't want to do I am trying to write this in a way that appears that I am mindful of the unpredictable events that could occur But insofar as I can plan ahead and insofar as I can predict my attitude and insofar as I have the ability to point myself towards one thing over another I feel the plan to stop talking about myself publicly is right <s> So this means that I won 't be blogging about my family Or really blogging at all <s> I am so thankful for all the people who have read my blog and commented Please if you can come to see one of the Jill amp Julia Shows this year For me this show is so meaningful it is an end of an era For 16 years I have been getting on stage and spilling my guts while simultaneously attempting to make people laugh That is a long time This decision feels like a death It is hard to envision myself as myself without the outlet and the drive to get onstage and talk about it On the other hand it doesn 't seem right to continue either This decision feels inevitable and yet surprising and mostly very very right I am so excited about this to be honest Imagine me a private person I recently joked with Jim Emerson about how I feel I was a butterfly but I am morphing into a caterpillar I 'll be posting all the places where Jill and I have booked shows very soon Thanks for reading <s> Botanic Gardens Kauai Hawaii I took this pic a few years ago when Mulan and I spent Christmas with friends in Kauai <s> I 've been thinking about Voltaire a bit In our last writing session Jim reminded me of the poem that Voltaire wrote after the Lisbon earthquake of <date> when all the priests were railing against the people themselves for being the culprit The disaster occurred because of their sinfulness And now <date> years later and we still have the like of Pat Robertson and his voodoo pact-with-the-devil Christian belief that Haiti brought all this on itself <s> Here is Voltaire is poem Poem on the Lisbon Disaster - Wikisource And here is a good excerpt What crime what sin had those young hearts conceived That lie bleeding and torn on mother is breast Did fallen Lisbon deeper drink of vice Than London Paris or sunlit Madrid In these

everywhere and this was the general attitude <s> I really think things are changing SLOWLY What shocks me is that while the mainstream may mock Robertson they don 't seem to take it a step further If God didn 't cause the earthquake then does God cause anything Is he a sad bystander Is he able to do anything about it Of course not Then why believe in any God at all But no one takes it that far It is PC to extoll the belief that God IS there to rely on you can cry on his shoulder you can ask for strength Why is that so acceptable And why did the font on my blog just change OH I cannot stop and

project at the house He is a man obsessed with lighting He wants to program every single light in our house so that we can stand at the door and push one button and every light we don 't want on will go off <s> This requires a lot of work hooking up this outlet but not that one etc He is frustrated with the software for the program and it is the third incarnation of this software he has worked with <s> He has been up for two nights until at least one or two a m working on the lighting project I kid with him and say when he gets it done I expect him to say with glee 'Now all you have to do

really a joke <s> I leave and go get a mammogram <s> I have not had one for a few years <s> I having had cervical cancer should be more vigilant but I have let things go I get to the Evanston Medical Center and read the book I am completely absorbed in 'Lacuna 'by Barbara Kingsolver It is such a great book a fictionalized account of a young Mexican American in the thirties who befriends Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera and Trotsky I am pulled out of my reverie by a stern woman asking me to put on a gown The gown is awkwardly configured so even after you tie it in the places it wants to be tied you have to hold it closed otherwise your whole front shows as you walk down the hallway to the mammogram machine The woman inside is friendly and I am thankful for her warm hands as she manipulates my breasts this way and that I think about what a weird job she has I wonder if she says to people 'I just sort of fell into it ' There is no hi 'en meaning in that configuration of words I just wonder if that is the phrase she 'd use <s> As I leave we discuss the gowns She agrees they suck <s> I leave and take a moment to consider that I could get a bad response on my mammogram and have cancer <s> I fantasize what I would do if I learned I had only one year to live I decide that I would just go places to look at animals and nature and the sky at night I would go to the Galapagos or Hawaii and just sit and watch <s> I don 't need to see any more people I 've seen big cities but I 've done it I get it Big vibrant city I crave quiet and nature without people I decide that I would have to pull Mulan out of school to go with me to Hawaii or the Galapagos Of course Michael would have to come he 'd have to shut down his business and come Jill Sobule would have to come too as well as Jim Emerson I guess there 'd be some people Then I think it would be bad for Mulan to be pulled out of school right now because she is really doing well and loves her school Then I remember this is all a fantasy I blink back tears and come back to life <s> I go to my favorite bread store in Evanston It is Friday and I get challah I don 't ask for challah bread I used to do that Then Michael told me that was like asking for Guinness beer You just say Guinness not Guinness beer just as you just say challah We like to buy challah for french toast on Sundays I don 't have Mulan with me but I remember while I am at this store that this was where Mulan made her first decent pun She said they should put a sign out on Fridays saying 'Celebrate it is Challah-Day ' While I am at the bread store

skeptical about how much they doctored itto get certain types of shots Mulan is rapt with the film and so is Arden - it is the first time my dog watched most of a movie But when it is over Mulan announces she is thrilled she is now let out of this horrible prison I 've put her in forcing her to watch this movie Also she announces that she will never eat a bird <s> Ohmygod I love my family so much <s> Mulan goes to her room Michael goes back to the lighting project and I come in here and write about my day <s> Snow snow everywhere <s> And I love it <s> Wow All those posts to the last blog entry have my head in constant conversation I think the post that I 've thought about the most was the one which indicated I was breaking the question down in a poor way Well there were many posts pointing that out This one broke down the debate in a different way - between religion with supernatural claims and religion without supernatural claims That is true I guess I don 't normally think of or remember that there are religions without supernatural claims <s> Bu 'hism is the only one I can think of Not all sects of Bu 'hism Or the Unitarian Church <s> To me religion works best as a ritual keeper and community builder These things are very important In my observations - which are mostly about my upbringing in Spokane in the Catholic church and then watching my friends who have stayed in the church - the best thing they get from their religion is the shared rituals and community These are the things that I really craved in retrospect I had mouthed the words and didn 't think all that much about the readings I liked Bach and the candles and the idea that I had stood in this same church year in and year out on one particular day that earmarked the dead of winter or the beginning of spring - saying the same things hearing the same songs watching kids grow up flirting with boys seeing who was getting married mourning those who had died All those things can be a part of a life without the supernatural <s> On the other hand the supernatural specifics of what we were all supposed to believe were in my opinion a great hindrance to the development of a skeptical outlook and even general critical thinking skills So the ideas we were so benignly taught had an insidious price We paid with our critical minds SOME of my friends from Spokane for example have - in my humble opinion - undeveloped political opinions Worse they back off from any debate They make ad homonym attacks Tragically some of them have no understanding of the tenants of other faiths and even of their own faith Sometimes it seems that they are even proud of their lack of information Is the Church to blame <repeatedchars> <s> I kinda think so I hate to say I do <s> But the rituals and community continue to give And I can see that it is a great value <s> I think the Unitarian Church can offer this but not at the cost of your critical mind <s> But for me I do not feel in need of the community anymore I like the idea of it but not the practicality of it It involves a great deal of socializing and I feel that I am filled up with that <s> What I crave now and I am fifty so maybe this is a natural thing to happen but I want less socializing and social obligation in my life I crave quiet and contemplation I want to learn I feel I am hungry to learn and read and think well it is almost as if I had scurvy and were in need of an orange And true learning and thinking take a lot of time and quiet With a husband and a child as well as a few very close friends I feel I am up to my ears in interaction with people A 'ing a church would put me over the edge Even if Mulan may benefit from it she would have an even more frazzled mother and I don 't think that is good I could just see myself getting caught up in it at first volunteering for five committees no 'ing 'yes 'to the bake sale and then being in the worst possible mood about it all for the next six months Wait This is what being at a public school is like already I 've so far been able to back away from most things But yes I feel guilty about it Guilty or Angry That is always my dilemma I think me and my friends would have been better served by a Church that did not subscribe to supernatural beliefs We would have gotten the ritual and community but not the inanity <s> But sometimes I wonder would we stick to it if it didn 't have a whiff of a real God on High I might not have It would require inculcating me about the need of community and social obligation and not about someone looking over my shoulder who could see everything <s> I wrote the above jumbled blog entry this morning and was intending all day to get back to it reread all those wonderful posts from the last entry and rewrite it <s> But now it is late and I have to fly to New York in the morning So I am just going to throw this out there <s> It is woefully inadequate in it is musings upon this topic <s> Jill Sobule and I are doing a show on

on my dog walk <s> Mulan Michael and I opened presents had breakfast and then flew to L <s> A Now I am here and I realize how much I miss it Yippity yah five days in L <s> A <s> Not much to report but I wrote this below last week and I guess I 'll paste it here now <s> Amongst the non-believers of this world there appears to be a split in thinking between 1 Those that think religion is good - regardless of truth - for some people Religion is useful for those who are trying to get sober for those who have no where to turn for those that might not follow society is rules for those who might not otherwise respect others for those in complete despair and for those that need the idea the concept - as a new drug - to get off another one 2 Those who think religion and the idea of God is never good for anyone <s> I have always put myself in the 1 category It suits me because I don 't want to proclaim that seeing stark reality which is very dark and full of potential catastrophe is good or possible for everyone <s> But this thinking is very condescending It is Plato saying religion is good for the masses It is Will Durant saying how religion helps to bind people together and so for society it is good It is AA using the idea of a higher power to get people to let go of another actual drug <s> But 2 is so arrogant too <s> I mean this is all just for the rumination - religion and the idea of God is not going away and most likely never will - so this is all just blathering about the number of angels who can dance on the head of a pin I have always stayed away from the 2 thinking because it puts me in a position of dismissing so much in others <s> I am not comfortable with it It is very judgey Of course that is no way to decide what you think Being judgey is the point of this whole debate But in my private thoughts what do I really think It is like a little debate between Plato and Voltaire Plato did think religion was good for the masses Voltaire believed religion enslaved people <s> Truthfully now I am beginning to lean towards Voltaire <s> I asked my husband yesterday if he thought religion did any person any good at all 'Think about Anne Lamott a nice liberal happy Christian 'I said 'Or people who get off drugs and alcohol because they find Jesus I mean aren 't we all better off because of that transfer of the more dangerous drug to the more benign one 'And he sai ' <weirdcaps> <s> But now those people are primed to follow Jesus might be the idea for now but it really could be anyone <s> They have made themselves programmable and basically they are sheep and now anyone could lead them - it could be to the top of a mountain or it could be off a cliff 'Again I am paraphrasing and a 'ing imagery for emphasis And may I remind you that I do not hang on this guy is every word far from it But I thought about that all day I mean I have always thought 1 was the benevolent point of view the humble point of view the less-judgemental and superior point of view but actually that is wrong <punctuationfreak> The 1 thinking is really so cynical and superior and 2 has all this faith in everyone to use rationality and critical thinking to get through 2 is actually the humble - or no the optimistic point of view Not that being humble or optimistic is some sort of proof for an argument But you know neither of these words is right it is more like empowering - it is the empowering point of view <s> I have not really come to any conclusions about this But I am just realizing how there is this split in thinking and I am not sure - I

watching a moving company depart with all of our possessions joined Michael as we drove together from California to Illinois There was a huge storm which prevented us from taking the route we wished to take - through Santa Fe and instead we drove south through Arizona and then Texas It took four days We had a dog in the car who wanted to kill really truly kill and eat the cat in the car We stopped at Motel 6s we saw billboards in Texas that proclaimed that Obama was not born in the U <s> S we watched Arden pee in ice for the first time It was an adventure <s> We arrived here just before Christmas slept in our new house all together on sleeping bags in the master bedroom and wandered our neighborhood thinking 'What the hell did we just do 'And what have I done this year Adjust be a mom who is around a lot do a few shows write a pilot and empty a bunch of boxes The house is still not totally organized - the basement is on it is way But I am much happier here and thrilled to be in this new family It really does feel like a family Mulan can barely remember life before Michael Last night we talked about the drive For Mulan this was our biggest adventure of all She often refers to the drive and wants to do it again - with the cat and the dog That part was not so much fun for me Anyway as I have not taken a picture the last couple of days I thought I 'd throw up that one of Arden a year ago on his way to his own new adventure here <s> What am I thinking about Well I am very sad about the healthcare 'overhaul ' I am very sad about Obama and I am wondering if he is really who I thought he was I read Robert Reich is and Glenn Greenwald is articles on Salon and I am just really so sad and so disappointed and I wish they would not vote for this deal and I like Howard Dean even more than I ever have and I hate Joe Leiberman even though this demise is not all his doing Last night I overheard Mulan telling Michael 'Mom was in the car driving and yelling 'That Joe Leiberman ' and her fists were clenched ' Anyway let is change the subject What other things am I thinking about I am thinking about all the letters I have gotten from people and how much they mean to me <s> I want to write back everyone and I hope to send at least a thank you I am trying to just be present and take it all in <s> I am thinking about some of the questions that people have asked Some

around <s> This time it was olive oil two smashed cloves of garlic a sprinkling of thyme a splash of sherry and some fish sauce but anything goes <s> Sear it so it s black outside and pink within let

<s> What if you could have forty million dollars completely tax free but you could never spend more than two days in the same city <s> This means that you 'd have to move all your stuff every two days You could rotate cities but you 'd have to put three cities in between every rotation So if you wanted to go back to whatever city you 're from you would have to make sure you stayed six days at three other cities before going back Would you take the money and resign yourself to the life of a nomad or would you stay put and live where you wanted for however long you wanted I don 't know what I 'd do If I took the money I 'd definitely invest in an rv i don 't know if I could do that forever though Not having to work ever would be nice but I may want to stay somewhere sometimes What would you do

<s> weird 'let is discuss what this word means to us to me it is one of the most positive words i know i think i generally use it to replace 'interesting 'but after trying to convince a guy the other night that me calling him 'weird 'was a massive compliment i realized i might be alone in this i am completely attracted to things and people that are curiously bizarre things i don 't quite understand but that none the less peak my interest i think most people i know feel the same way but whenever i use the word with a big smile on my face i get the o 'est looks i also tend to take it as a compliment when i am called 'weird ' even though i am sure it is often not meant that way <smiley> google image 'weird 'and this is the first thing that comes up see how great it is 
<s> I like flipping my blankets over to the cold side when I sleep the smell of sun-dried laundry back scratches food the winter is first snowfall beach days wallowing in music on a gloomy wet vancouver day crazy moments with people that I am crazy for nail polish avocados big warm hugs large meadows that are frolick-a-ble the summertime qoola french leggings tea metal water bottles school supply shopping salmon cream cheese and some days more than others - stepping out of my comfort zone
