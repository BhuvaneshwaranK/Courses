- environment : when initialized create a stdio object with stdio as id...
- messageClass should exist even if it doesn't do anything right now...


what if we send a object that is a son of the MessageObject
idem check if inheritence works

add errors when sending message to Integer(maybe others) with an anormal amount of parameters
